  author        = "Kingma, Diederik P and Ba, Jimmy",
  abstract      = "We introduce Adam, an algorithm for first-order
                   gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective
                   functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order
                   moments. The method is straightforward to implement, is
                   computationally efficient, has little memory requirements,
                   is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is
                   well suited for problems that are large in terms of data
                   and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for
                   non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy
                   and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive
                   interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some
                   connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was
                   inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical
                   convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret
                   bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best
                   known results under the online convex optimization
                   framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works
                   well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic
                   optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant
                   of Adam based on the infinity norm.",

              downstream genomic analyses and are of critical importance.
              Recent genome assembly projects have relied on a combination of
              noisy long-read sequencing and accurate short-read sequencing,
              with the former offering greater assembly continuity and the
              latter providing higher consensus accuracy. The recently
              introduced Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) HiFi sequencing
              technology bridges this divide by delivering long reads (>10 kbp)
              with high per-base accuracy (>99.9\%). Here we present HiCanu, a
              modification of the Canu assembler designed to leverage the full
              potential of HiFi reads via homopolymer compression,
              overlap-based error correction, and aggressive false overlap
              filtering. We benchmark HiCanu with a focus on the recovery of
              haplotype diversity, major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
              variants, satellite DNAs, and segmental duplications. For diploid
              human genomes sequenced to 30$\times$ HiFi coverage, HiCanu
              achieved superior accuracy and allele recovery compared to the
              current state of the art. On the effectively haploid CHM13 human
              cell line, HiCanu achieved an NG50 contig size of 77 Mbp with a
              per-base consensus accuracy of 99.999\% (QV50), surpassing recent
              assemblies of high-coverage, ultralong Oxford Nanopore
              Technologies (ONT) reads in terms of both accuracy and
              continuity. This HiCanu assembly correctly resolves 337 out of
              341 validation BACs sampled from known segmental duplications and
              provides the first preliminary assemblies of nine complete human
              centromeric regions. Although gaps and errors still remain within
              the most challenging regions of the genome, these results

              long-read sequencing technologies provides both new challenges
              and potential solutions to the issue. Here, we present
              HaploMerger2 (HM2), an automated pipeline for rebuilding both
              haploid sub-assemblies from the polymorphic diploid genome
              assembly. It is designed to work on pre-existing diploid
              assemblies, which are typically created by using de novo
              assemblers. HM2 can process any diploid assemblies, but it is
              especially suitable for diploid assemblies with high
              heterozygosity ($\geq$3\%), which can be difficult for other
              tools. This pipeline also implements flexible and sensitive
              assembly error detection, a hierarchical scaffolding procedure
              and a reliable gap-closing method for haploid sub-assemblies.
              Using HM2, we demonstrate that two haploid sub-assemblies

              insert of interest, and a single-stranded hairpin loop on either
              end, which provides a site for primer binding. Structurally, this
              format resembles a linear double-stranded molecule, and yet it is

              from both the sense and antisense strands of the insert region.

              hifiasm strives to preserve the contiguity of all haplotypes.
              This feature enables the development of a graph trio binning
              algorithm that greatly advances over standard trio binning. On
              three human and five nonhuman datasets, including California

              detection. Recently, the deep sequence coverage generated by

              sequence to be processed during a genome project to grow rapidly,
              and has rendered current k-mer counting tools too slow and memory

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Haplotype assembly is the process of assigning the
              different alleles of the variants covered by mapped sequencing
              reads to the two haplotypes of the genome of a human individual.
              Long reads, which are nowadays cheaper to produce and more widely
              available than ever before, have been used to reduce the
              fragmentation of the assembled haplotypes since their ability to
              span several variants along the genome. These long reads are also
              characterized by a high error rate, an issue which may be
              mitigated, however, with larger sets of reads, when this error
              rate is uniform across genome positions. Unfortunately, current
              state-of-the-art dynamic programming approaches designed for long
              reads deal only with limited coverages. RESULTS: Here, we propose
              a new method for assembling haplotypes which combines and extends
              the features of previous approaches to deal with long reads and
              higher coverages. In particular, our algorithm is able to
              dynamically adapt the estimated number of errors at each variant
              site, while minimizing the total number of error corrections
              necessary for finding a feasible solution. This allows our method
              to significantly reduce the required computational resources,
              allowing to consider datasets composed of higher coverages. The
              algorithm has been implemented in a freely available tool,
              HapCHAT: Haplotype Assembly Coverage Handling by Adapting
              Thresholds. An experimental analysis on sequencing reads with up
              to 60 $\times$ coverage reveals improvements in accuracy and
              recall achieved by considering a higher coverage with lower
              runtimes. CONCLUSIONS: Our method leverages the long-range
              information of sequencing reads that allows to obtain assembled
              haplotypes fragmented in a lower number of unphased haplotype
              blocks. At the same time, our method is also able to deal with
              higher coverages to better correct the errors in the original
              reads and to obtain more accurate haplotypes as a result.

              different data types-dilution pool sequencing, linked-read
              sequencing, single molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing, and
              proximity ligation (Hi-C) sequencing-we show that HapCUT2 rapidly
              assembles haplotypes with best-in-class accuracy for all data
              types. In particular, HapCUT2 scales well for high sequencing
              coverage and rapidly assembled haplotypes for two long-read WGS
              data sets on which other methods struggled. Further, HapCUT2
              directly models Hi-C specific error modalities, resulting in
              significant improvements in error rates compared to HapCUT, the
              only other method that could assemble haplotypes from Hi-C data.
              Using HapCUT2, haplotype assembly from a 90$\times$ coverage
              whole-genome Hi-C data set yielded high-resolution haplotypes
              (78.6\% of variants phased in a single block) with high pairwise
              phasing accuracy (∼98\% across chromosomes). Our results
              demonstrate that HapCUT2 is a robust tool for haplotype assembly
              applicable to data from diverse sequencing technologies.",

  abstract = "The human genome is diploid, which requires assigning
              heterozygous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to the two
              copies of the genome. The resulting haplotypes, lists of SNPs
              belonging to each copy, are crucial for downstream analyses in
              population genetics. Currently, statistical approaches, which are
              oblivious to direct read information, constitute the
              state-of-the-art. Haplotype assembly, which addresses phasing
              directly from sequencing reads, suffers from the fact that
              sequencing reads of the current generation are too short to serve
              the purposes of genome-wide phasing. While future-technology
              sequencing reads will contain sufficient amounts of SNPs per read
              for phasing, they are also likely to suffer from higher
              sequencing error rates. Currently, no haplotype assembly
              approaches exist that allow for taking both increasing read
              length and sequencing error information into account. Here, we
              suggest WhatsHap, the first approach that yields provably optimal
              solutions to the weighted minimum error correction problem in
              runtime linear in the number of SNPs. WhatsHap is a fixed
              parameter tractable (FPT) approach with coverage as the
              parameter. We demonstrate that WhatsHap can handle datasets of
              coverage up to 20$\times$, and that 15$\times$ are generally
              enough for reliably phasing long reads, even at significantly
              elevated sequencing error rates. We also find that the switch and
              flip error rates of the haplotypes we output are favorable when
              comparing them with state-of-the-art statistical phasers.",

  abstract = "The author was led to the study given in this paper from a
              consideration of large scale computing machines in which a large
              number of operations must be performed without a single error in
              the end result. This problem of ``doing things right'' on a large
              scale is not essentially new; in a telephone central office, for
              example, a very large number of operations are performed while
              the errors leading to wrong numbers are kept well under control,
              though they have not been completely eliminated. This has been
              achieved, in part, through the use of self-checking circuits. The
              occasional failure that escapes routine checking is still
              detected by the customer and will, if it persists, result in
              customer complaint, while if it is transient it will produce only
              occasional wrong numbers. At the same time the rest of the
              central office functions satisfactorily. In a digital computer,
              on the other hand, a single failure usually means the complete
              failure, in the sense that if it is detected no more computing
              can be done until the failure is located and corrected, while if
              it escapes detection then it invalidates all subsequent
              operations of the machine. Put in other words, in a telephone
              central office there are a number of parallel paths which are
              more or less independent of each other; in a digital machine
              there is usually a single long path which passes through the same
              piece of equipment many, many times before the answer is
              obtained.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Heterochromatin plays an important role in chromosome
              function and gene regulation. Despite the availability of
              polytene chromosomes and genome sequence, the heterochromatin of
              the major malaria vector Anopheles gambiae has not been mapped
              and characterized. RESULTS: To determine the extent of
              heterochromatin within the An. gambiae genome, genes were
              physically mapped to the euchromatin-heterochromatin transition
              zone of polytene chromosomes. The study found that a minimum of
              232 genes reside in 16.6 Mb of mapped heterochromatin. Gene
              ontology analysis revealed that heterochromatin is enriched in
              genes with DNA-binding and regulatory activities. Immunostaining
              of the An. gambiae chromosomes with antibodies against Drosophila
              melanogaster heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) and the nuclear
              envelope protein lamin Dm0 identified the major invariable sites
              of the proteins' localization in all regions of pericentric
              heterochromatin, diffuse intercalary heterochromatin, and
              euchromatic region 9C of the 2R arm, but not in the compact
              intercalary heterochromatin. To better understand the molecular
              differences among chromatin types, novel Bayesian statistical
              models were developed to analyze genome features. The study found
              that heterochromatin and euchromatin differ in gene density and
              the coverage of retroelements and segmental duplications. The
              pericentric heterochromatin had the highest coverage of
              retroelements and tandem repeats, while intercalary
              heterochromatin was enriched with segmental duplications. We also
              provide evidence that the diffuse intercalary heterochromatin has
              a higher coverage of DNA transposable elements, minisatellites,
              and satellites than does the compact intercalary heterochromatin.
              The investigation of 42-Mb assembly of unmapped genomic scaffolds
              showed that it has molecular characteristics similar to
              cytologically mapped heterochromatin. CONCLUSIONS: Our results
              demonstrate that Anopheles polytene chromosomes and whole-genome
              shotgun assembly render the mapping and characterization of a
              significant part of heterochromatic scaffolds a possibility.
              These results reveal the strong association between
              characteristics of the genome features and morphological types of
              chromatin. Initial analysis of the An. gambiae heterochromatin

              genome assemblies in limited regions and contaminating bacterial

              clones was used to place 15 unmapped scaffolds (sizes totaling
              5.34 Mbp) in the pericentromeric regions of the chromosomes and
              oriented a further 9 scaffolds. Additional analysis by in situ
              hybridization of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones
              placed 1.32 Mbp (5 scaffolds) in the physical gaps between
              scaffolds on euchromatic parts of the chromosomes. The Y
              chromosome sequence information (0.18 Mbp) remains highly
              incomplete and fragmented among 55 short scaffolds. Analysis of
              BAC end sequences showed that 22 inter-scaffold gaps were spanned
              by BAC clones. Unmapped scaffolds were also aligned to the

              8.18 Mbp (144 scaffolds) that are probably represented in the

              Mbp of alternative assembly was identified within mapped
              scaffolds. Scaffolds comprising 1.97 Mbp (679 small scaffolds)
              were identified as probably derived from contaminating bacterial

              the existence of 'chromosome territories'. We use proximity

              since 1991, it had not been epidemic in Haiti for at least 100
              years. Recently, however, there has been a severe outbreak of
              cholera in Haiti. METHODS: We used third-generation
              single-molecule real-time DNA sequencing to determine the genome
              sequences of 2 clinical Vibrio cholerae isolates from the current
              outbreak in Haiti, 1 strain that caused cholera in Latin America
              in 1991, and 2 strains isolated in South Asia in 2002 and 2008.
              Using primary sequence data, we compared the genomes of these 5
              strains and a set of previously obtained partial genomic
              sequences of 23 diverse strains of V. cholerae to assess the
              likely origin of the cholera outbreak in Haiti. RESULTS: Both
              single-nucleotide variations and the presence and structure of
              hypervariable chromosomal elements indicate that there is a close
              relationship between the Haitian isolates and variant V. cholerae
              El Tor O1 strains isolated in Bangladesh in 2002 and 2008. In
              contrast, analysis of genomic variation of the Haitian isolates
              reveals a more distant relationship with circulating South
              American isolates. CONCLUSIONS: The Haitian epidemic is probably
              the result of the introduction, through human activity, of a V.

              up to several hundred bases long, SMS sequencing produces reads
              up to tens of kilobases long. Existing alignment methods are
              either too inefficient for high-throughput datasets, or not
              sensitive enough to align SMS reads, which have a higher error
              rate than Next-Generation sequencing. RESULTS: We describe the

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Recent developments in third-gen long read sequencing
              and diploid-aware assemblers have resulted in the rapid release
              of numerous reference-quality assemblies for diploid genomes.
              However, assembly of highly heterozygous genomes is still
              problematic when regional heterogeneity is so high that haplotype
              homology is not recognised during assembly. This results in
              regional duplication rather than consolidation into allelic
              variants and can cause issues with downstream analysis, for
              example variant discovery, or haplotype reconstruction using the
              diploid assembly with unpaired allelic contigs. RESULTS: A new
              pipeline-Purge Haplotigs-was developed specifically for third-gen
              sequencing-based assemblies to automate the reassignment of
              allelic contigs, and to assist in the manual curation of genome
              assemblies. The pipeline uses a draft haplotype-fused assembly or
              a diploid assembly, read alignments, and repeat annotations to
              identify allelic variants in the primary assembly. The pipeline
              was tested on a simulated dataset and on four recent diploid
              (phased) de novo assemblies from third-generation long-read
              sequencing, and compared with a similar tool. After processing
              with Purge Haplotigs, haploid assemblies were less duplicated
              with minimal impact on genome completeness, and diploid
              assemblies had more pairings of allelic contigs. CONCLUSIONS:
              Purge Haplotigs improves the haploid and diploid representations
              of third-gen sequencing based genome assemblies by identifying
              and reassigning allelic contigs. The implementation is fast and
              scales well with large genomes, and it is less likely to
              over-purge repetitive or paralogous elements compared to
              alignment-only based methods. The software is available at

              data, in terms of both computational parallelization and
              simplified user interface. Here we introduce a software,
              cellsnp-lite, implemented in C/C ++ and based on well-supported
              package htslib, for genotyping in single-cell sequencing data for
              both droplet and well based platforms. On various experimental

              speed and memory efficiency with retaining highly concordant

              single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data analysis. Low-quality cells
              are removed from the analysis during the QC process to avoid
              misinterpretation of the data. An important QC metric is the
              mitochondrial proportion (mtDNA\%), which is used as a threshold
              to filter out low-quality cells. Early publications in the field
              established a threshold of 5\% and since then, it has been used
              as a default in several software packages for scRNA-seq data
              analysis, and adopted as a standard in many scRNA-seq studies.
              However, the validity of using a uniform threshold across
              different species, single-cell technologies, tissues and cell
              types has not been adequately assessed. RESULTS: We
              systematically analyzed 5 530 106 cells reported in 1349
              annotated datasets available in the PanglaoDB database and found
              that the average mtDNA\% in scRNA-seq data across human tissues
              is significantly higher than in mouse tissues. This difference is
              not confounded by the platform used to generate the data. Based
              on this finding, we propose new reference values of the mtDNA\%
              for 121 tissues of mouse and 44 tissues of humans. In general,
              for mouse tissues, the 5\% threshold performs well to distinguish
              between healthy and low-quality cells. However, for human
              tissues, the 5\% threshold should be reconsidered as it fails to
              accurately discriminate between healthy and low-quality cells in
              29.5\% (13 of 44) tissues analyzed. We conclude that omitting the
              mtDNA\% QC filter or adopting a suboptimal mtDNA\% threshold may
              lead to erroneous biological interpretations of scRNA-seq data.

  abstract = "MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) measures gene
              expression at the resolution of individual cells. Massively
              multiplexed single-cell profiling has enabled large-scale
              transcriptional analyses of thousands of cells in complex
              tissues. In most cases, the true identity of individual cells is
              unknown and needs to be inferred from the transcriptomic data.
              Existing methods typically cluster (group) cells based on
              similarities of their gene expression profiles and assign the
              same identity to all cells within each cluster using the averaged
              expression levels. However, scRNA-seq experiments typically
              produce low-coverage sequencing data for each cell, which hinders
              the clustering process. RESULTS: We introduce scMatch, which
              directly annotates single cells by identifying their closest
              match in large reference datasets. We used this strategy to
              annotate various single-cell datasets and evaluated the impacts
              of sequencing depth, similarity metric and reference datasets. We
              found that scMatch can rapidly and robustly annotate single cells
              with comparable accuracy to another recent cell annotation tool
              (SingleR), but that it is quicker and can handle larger reference

              algorithm that delineates shared and dataset-specific features of
              cell identity. We applied it to four diverse and challenging

              region-specific and sexually dimorphic gene expression in the

              expression in the human substantia nigra, comparing cell states
              in specific donors and relating cell types to those in the mouse.
              Third, we integrated in situ and single-cell expression data to
              spatially locate fine subtypes of cells present in the mouse
              frontal cortex. Finally, we jointly defined mouse cortical cell

              systematic variations that present a challenge to batch-effect
              removal and data integration. With continued growth expected in
              scRNA-seq data, achieving effective batch integration with
              available computational resources is crucial. Here, we perform an
              in-depth benchmark study on available batch correction methods to
              determine the most suitable method for batch-effect removal.
              RESULTS: We compare 14 methods in terms of computational runtime,
              the ability to handle large datasets, and batch-effect correction
              efficacy while preserving cell type purity. Five scenarios are
              designed for the study: identical cell types with different
              technologies, non-identical cell types, multiple batches, big
              data, and simulated data. Performance is evaluated using four

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Single-cell transcriptomics is rapidly advancing our
              understanding of the cellular composition of complex tissues and
              organisms. A major limitation in most analysis pipelines is the
              reliance on manual annotations to determine cell identities,
              which are time-consuming and irreproducible. The exponential
              growth in the number of cells and samples has prompted the
              adaptation and development of supervised classification methods
              for automatic cell identification. RESULTS: Here, we benchmarked
              22 classification methods that automatically assign cell
              identities including single-cell-specific and general-purpose
              classifiers. The performance of the methods is evaluated using 27
              publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing datasets of
              different sizes, technologies, species, and levels of complexity.
              We use 2 experimental setups to evaluate the performance of each
              method for within dataset predictions (intra-dataset) and across
              datasets (inter-dataset) based on accuracy, percentage of
              unclassified cells, and computation time. We further evaluate the
              methods' sensitivity to the input features, number of cells per
              population, and their performance across different annotation
              levels and datasets. We find that most classifiers perform well
              on a variety of datasets with decreased accuracy for complex
              datasets with overlapping classes or deep annotations. The
              general-purpose support vector machine classifier has overall the
              best performance across the different experiments. CONCLUSIONS:

@ARTICLE{fpimpute,
  title    = "False signals induced by single-cell imputation",
  author   = "Andrews, Tallulah S and Hemberg, Martin",
  abstract = "Background: Single-cell RNA-seq is a powerful tool for measuring
              gene expression at the resolution of individual cells. A
              challenge in the analysis of this data is the large amount of
              zero values, representing either missing data or no expression.
              Several imputation approaches have been proposed to address this
              issue, but they generally rely on structure inherent to the
              dataset under consideration they may not provide any additional
              information, hence, are limited by the information contained
              therein and the validity of their assumptions. Methods: We
              evaluated the risk of generating false positive or irreproducible
              differential expression when imputing data with six different
              methods. We applied each method to a variety of simulated
              datasets as well as to permuted real single-cell RNA-seq datasets
              and consider the number of false positive gene-gene correlations
              and differentially expressed genes. Using matched 10X and
              Smart-seq2 data we examined whether cell-type specific markers
              were reproducible across datasets derived from the same tissue
              before and after imputation. Results: The extent of
              false-positives introduced by imputation varied considerably by
              method. Data smoothing based methods, MAGIC, knn-smooth and dca,
              generated many false-positives in both real and simulated data.
              Model-based imputation methods typically generated fewer
              false-positives but this varied greatly depending on the
              diversity of cell-types in the sample. All imputation methods
              decreased the reproducibility of cell-type specific markers,
              although this could be mitigated by selecting markers with large
              effect size and significance. Conclusions: Imputation of
              single-cell RNA-seq data introduces circularity that can generate
              false-positive results. Thus, statistical tests applied to
              imputed data should be treated with care. Additional filtering by
              effect size can reduce but not fully eliminate these effects. Of
              the methods we considered, SAVER was the least likely to generate
              false or irreproducible results, thus should be favoured over
              alternatives if imputation is necessary.",

              (scRNA-seq) technologies has led to the emergence of many methods
              for removing systematic technical noises, including imputation
              methods, which aim to address the increased sparsity observed in
              single-cell data. Although many imputation methods have been
              developed, there is no consensus on how methods compare to each
              other. RESULTS: Here, we perform a systematic evaluation of 18
              scRNA-seq imputation methods to assess their accuracy and
              usability. We benchmark these methods in terms of the similarity
              between imputed cell profiles and bulk samples and whether these
              methods recover relevant biological signals or introduce spurious
              noise in downstream differential expression, unsupervised
              clustering, and pseudotemporal trajectory analyses, as well as
              their computational run time, memory usage, and scalability.
              Methods are evaluated using data from both cell lines and tissues
              and from both plate- and droplet-based single-cell platforms.
              CONCLUSIONS: We found that the majority of scRNA-seq imputation
              methods outperformed no imputation in recovering gene expression
              observed in bulk RNA-seq. However, the majority of the methods

              imputation, in particular for clustering and trajectory analysis,
              and thus should be used with caution. In addition, we found

              each evaluation aspect. Overall, MAGIC, kNN-smoothing, and SAVER

              challenges for identifying genes that show genuine heterogeneous
              expression within the population of cells under study. BASiCS
              (Bayesian Analysis of Single-Cell Sequencing data) is an
              integrated Bayesian hierarchical model where: (i) cell-specific
              normalisation constants are estimated as part of the model

  abstract = "HISAT (hierarchical indexing for spliced alignment of

              RNA sequencing experiments. HISAT uses an indexing scheme based
              on the Burrows-Wheeler transform and the Ferragina-Manzini (FM)
              index, employing two types of indexes for alignment: a
              whole-genome FM index to anchor each alignment and numerous local
              FM indexes for very rapid extensions of these alignments. HISAT's
              hierarchical index for the human genome contains 48,000 local FM
              indexes, each representing a genomic region of ?64,000 bp. Tests

              system currently available, with equal or better accuracy than
              any other method. Despite its large number of indexes, HISAT

              used to measure levels of gene expression and to identify novel
              splice variants of genes. However, current software for aligning
              RNA-Seq data to a genome relies on known splice junctions and
              cannot identify novel ones. TopHat is an efficient read-mapping
              algorithm designed to align reads from an RNA-Seq experiment to a
              reference genome without relying on known splice sites. RESULTS:
              We mapped the RNA-Seq reads from a recent mammalian RNA-Seq
              experiment and recovered more than 72\% of the splice junctions
              reported by the annotation-based software from that study, along
              with nearly 20,000 previously unreported junctions. The TopHat
              pipeline is much faster than previous systems, mapping nearly 2.2

              entire RNA-Seq experiment in less than a day on a standard

              two read mappers and five variant callers, both on a haploid

              Minimap2 is a general-purpose alignment program to map DNA or

              with accurate short reads of $\geq$ 100bp in length, $\geq$1kb

               alignment of longer reads where indels may occur frequently. The
               speed of MAQ is also a concern when the alignment is scaled up

               Burrows--Wheeler Transform (BWT), to efficiently align short

              counting. Its applications include developing de Bruijn graph
              genome assemblers, fast multiple sequence alignment and repeat
              detection. The tremendous amounts of NGS data require fast
              algorithms for k-mer counting, preferably using moderate amounts
              of memory. RESULTS: We present a novel method for k-mer counting,
              on large datasets about twice faster than the strongest
              competitors (Jellyfish 2, KMC 1), using about 12 GB (or less) of
              RAM. Our disk-based method bears some resemblance to
              MSPKmerCounter, yet replacing the original minimizers with
              signatures (a carefully selected subset of all minimizers) and
              using (k, x)-mers allows to significantly reduce the I/O and a
              highly parallel overall architecture allows to achieve
              unprecedented processing speeds. For example, KMC 2 counts the
              28-mers of a human reads collection with 44-fold coverage (106 GB

              approximately 560-780 thousand years before present (kyr BP). Our
              data represent the oldest full genome sequence determined so far

              Przewalski's horse (E. f. przewalskii) and a donkey (E. asinus).
              Our analyses suggest that the Equus lineage giving rise to all
              contemporary horses, zebras and donkeys originated 4.0-4.5
              million years before present (Myr BP), twice the conventionally

              of severe climatic changes. We estimate that the Przewalski's and

              immune system and olfaction throughout horse evolution. Finally,
              we identify 29 genomic regions among horse breeds that deviate
              from neutrality and show low levels of genetic variation compared

              generating vast amounts of data. Fast, flexible and memory
              efficient implementations are needed in order to facilitate

              present a multithreaded program suite called ANGSD. This program
              can calculate various summary statistics, and perform association
              mapping and population genetic analyses utilizing the full
              information in next generation sequencing data by working
              directly on the raw sequencing data or by using genotype
              likelihoods. CONCLUSIONS: The open source c/c++ program ANGSD is
              available at http://www.popgen.dk/angsd . The program is tested
              and validated on GNU/Linux systems. The program facilitates

              second-strand cDNA synthesis, T7 RNA polymerase was used to

              amplification has been achieved from nanogram quantities of cDNA.
              The amplified material is similar in size distribution to the

              molecular identifiers (UMIs) to reveal patterns of alternative
              full-length isoform expression in single cells from the mouse
              brain. We found a surprising amount of isoform diversity, even
              after applying a conservative definition of what constitutes an
              isoform. Genes tend to have one or a few isoforms highly
              expressed and a larger number of isoforms expressed at a low
              level. However, for many genes, nearly every sequenced mRNA
              molecule was unique, and many events affected coding regions
              suggesting previously unknown protein diversity in single cells.
              Exon junctions in coding regions were less prone to splicing
              errors than those in non-coding regions, indicating purifying
              selection on splice donor and acceptor efficiency. CONCLUSIONS:
              Our findings indicate that mRNA isoform diversity is an important
              source of biological variability also in single cells.",

              discoveries of important biological or medical benefit.
              Sequencing projects have traditionally used long (400-800 base
              pair) reads, but the existence of reference sequences for the
              human and many other genomes makes it possible to develop new,
              fast approaches to re-sequencing, whereby shorter reads are
              compared to a reference to identify intraspecies genetic
              variation. Here we report an approach that generates several
              billion bases of accurate nucleotide sequence per experiment at
              low cost. Single molecules of DNA are attached to a flat surface,
              amplified in situ and used as templates for synthetic sequencing
              with fluorescent reversible terminator deoxyribonucleotides.
              Images of the surface are analysed to generate high-quality
              sequence. We demonstrate application of this approach to human
              genome sequencing on flow-sorted X chromosomes and then scale the
              approach to determine the genome sequence of a male Yoruba from
              Ibadan, Nigeria. We build an accurate consensus sequence from
              >30x average depth of paired 35-base reads. We characterize four
              million single-nucleotide polymorphisms and four hundred thousand
              structural variants, many of which were previously unknown. Our
              approach is effective for accurate, rapid and economical

              locked up in a tissue section that is only partially accessed,
              due mainly to the limitations of tools and methods. Often tissues
              are assessed primarily based on visual analysis of one or two
              proteins, or 2-3 DNA or RNA molecules. Even while analysis is
              still based on visual perception, image analysis is starting to
              address the variability of human perception. This is in contrast
              to measuring characteristics that are substantially out of reach
              of human perception, such as parameters revealed through

  abstract = "The role of immunohistochemistry (IHC) in the management of
              cancer has expanded to provide improved diagnostic
              classification, as well as guidance on disease prognosis,
              therapy, and relapse. These new tasks require evaluation of an
              increasing number of protein targets; however, conventional
              multiplexing, usually achieved using serial tissue sections
              stained for a single analyte per slide, can exhaust small biopsy
              specimens, complicate slide-to-slide protein expression
              correlation, and leave insufficient material for additional
              molecular assays. A new approach, mass spectrometry
              immunohistochemistry (MSIHC), compatible with high levels of
              target multiplexing and suitable for use on formalin-fixed,
              paraffin-embedded samples can circumvent many of these issues.
              The strategy employs antibodies that are labeled with elemental
              mass tags, such as isotopically pure lanthanides not typically
              found in biological specimens, rather than with typical
              fluorophores or chromogens. The metal-labeled antibodies are then
              detected in tissue using lasers or ion beams to liberate the tags
              for subsequent mass spectrometry detection. Within a given
              multiplexed IHC panel, the metal labels are selected so that
              their respective masses do not overlap. More than 30 antibodies
              have been imaged simultaneously, and up to 100 antibodies could
              potentially be detected at once if the full available mass
              spectrum is deployed. MSIHC has a number of advantages over
              conventional IHC techniques. Background due to autofluorescence
              is absent and the dynamic range is 10(5), exceeding
              immunofluorescence and chromogenic IHC by 100-fold and 1000-fold,
              respectively. Detection of labeled primary antibodies improves
              assay linearity over both chromogenic and fluorescent IHC.
              Multiplexed mass-tagged antibodies incubated simultaneously with
              tissue do not appear to cross-interfere, and because the mass
              tags do not degrade, samples are stable indefinitely. The imaging
              resolution of multiplexed ion-beam imaging can be better than
              light microscopy. With appropriate instrumentation, MSIHC has the
              potential to transform research and clinical pathology practice.",

              transcript prevalence and to test the linear range of transcript
              detection, which spanned five orders of magnitude. Although >90\%

              additional promoters, exons and 3' untranscribed regions, as well
              as new candidate microRNA precursors. RNA splice events, which

              directly by mapping splice-crossing sequence reads. We observed
              1.45 x 10(5) distinct splices, and alternative splices were

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: High throughput sequencing-by-synthesis is an
              emerging technology that allows the rapid production of millions
              of bases of data. Although the sequence reads are short, they can
              readily be used for re-sequencing. By re-sequencing the mRNA
              products of a cell, one may rapidly discover polymorphisms and
              splice variants particular to that cell. RESULTS: We present the
              utility of massively parallel sequencing by synthesis for
              profiling the transcriptome of a human prostate cancer cell-line,
              LNCaP, that has been treated with the synthetic androgen, R1881.
              Through the generation of approximately 20 megabases (MB) of EST
              data, we detect transcription from over 10,000 gene loci, 25
              previously undescribed alternative splicing events involving
              known exons, and over 1,500 high quality single nucleotide
              discrepancies with the reference human sequence. Further, we map
              nearly 10,000 ESTs to positions on the genome where no
              transcription is currently predicted to occur. We also
              characterize various obstacles with using sequencing by synthesis
              for transcriptome analysis and propose solutions to these
              problems. CONCLUSION: The use of high-throughput
              sequencing-by-synthesis methods for transcript profiling allows
              the specific and sensitive detection of many of a cell's
              transcripts, and also allows the discovery of high quality base
              discrepancies, and alternative splice variants. Thus, this
              technology may provide an effective means of understanding
              various disease states, discovering novel targets for disease
              treatment, and discovery of novel transcripts.",

              formation in hydrothermal vents and delivery to Earth via

              Sequencing Consortium published their initial drafts of the human
              genome, which revolutionized the field of genomics. While these
              drafts and the updates that followed effectively covered the
              euchromatic fraction of the genome, the heterochromatin and many
              other complex regions were left unfinished or erroneous.
              Addressing this remaining 8\% of the genome, the
              Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T) Consortium has finished the first
              truly complete 3.055 billion base pair (bp) sequence of a human
              genome, representing the largest improvement to the human
              reference genome since its initial release. The new T2T-CHM13
              reference includes gapless assemblies for all 22 autosomes plus
              Chromosome X, corrects numerous errors, and introduces nearly 200
              million bp of novel sequence containing 2,226 paralogous gene
              copies, 115 of which are predicted to be protein coding. The
              newly completed regions include all centromeric satellite arrays
              and the short arms of all five acrocentric chromosomes, unlocking
              these complex regions of the genome to variational and functional

              genome (GRCh38) is the most accurate and complete vertebrate
              genome ever produced. However, no single chromosome has been
              finished end to end, and hundreds of unresolved gaps persist1,2.
              Here we present a human genome assembly that surpasses the
              continuity of GRCh382, along with a gapless, telomere-to-telomere
              assembly of a human chromosome. This was enabled by
              high-coverage, ultra-long-read nanopore sequencing of the
              complete hydatidiform mole CHM13 genome, combined with
              complementary technologies for quality improvement and
              validation. Focusing our efforts on the human X chromosome3, we
              reconstructed the centromeric satellite DNA array (approximately
              3.1 Mb) and closed the 29 remaining gaps in the current
              reference, including new sequences from the human pseudoautosomal
              regions and from cancer-testis ampliconic gene families (CT-X and
              GAGE). These sequences will be integrated into future human
              reference genome releases. In addition, the complete chromosome
              X, combined with the ultra-long nanopore data, allowed us to map
              methylation patterns across complex tandem repeats and satellite
              arrays. Our results demonstrate that finishing the entire human
              genome is now within reach, and the data presented here will

              chromosome-scale phasing or require pedigree information, which
              limits their application. We present a method named diploid
              assembly (DipAsm) that uses long, accurate reads and long-range
              conformation data for single individuals to generate a
              chromosome-scale phased assembly within 1 day. Applied to four
              public human genomes, PGP1, HG002, NA12878 and HG00733, DipAsm
              produced haplotype-resolved assemblies with minimum contig length
              needed to cover 50\% of the known genome (NG50) up to 25 Mb and

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Genome assembly is typically a two-stage process:
              contig assembly followed by the use of paired sequencing reads to
              join contigs into scaffolds. Scaffolds are usually the focus of
              reported assembly statistics; longer scaffolds greatly facilitate
              the use of genome sequences in downstream analyses, and it is
              appealing to present larger numbers as metrics of assembly
              performance. However, scaffolds are highly prone to errors,
              especially when generated using short reads, which can directly
              result in inflated assembly statistics. RESULTS: Here we provide
              the first independent evaluation of scaffolding tools for
              second-generation sequencing data. We find large variations in
              the quality of results depending on the tool and dataset used.
              Even extremely simple test cases of perfect input, constructed to
              elucidate the behaviour of each algorithm, produced some
              surprising results. We further dissect the performance of the
              scaffolders using real and simulated sequencing data derived from
              the genomes of Staphylococcus aureus, Rhodobacter sphaeroides,
              Plasmodium falciparum and Homo sapiens. The results from
              simulated data are of high quality, with several of the tools
              producing perfect output. However, at least 10\% of joins remains
              unidentified when using real data. CONCLUSIONS: The scaffolders
              vary in their usability, speed and number of correct and missed
              joins made between contigs. Results from real data highlight
              opportunities for further improvements of the tools. Overall,
              SGA, SOPRA and SSPACE generally outperform the other tools on our
              datasets. However, the quality of the results is highly dependent

              interactions that ultimately lead to fertilization. As with other
              Diptera, mosquito sperm have a complex journey to their ultimate
              destination, the egg. After copulation, sperm spend a short time
              at the site of insemination where they are hyperactivated and
              quickly congregate near the entrance of the spermathecal ducts.
              Within minutes, they travel up the narrow ducts to the
              spermathecae, likely through the combined efforts of female
              transport and sperm locomotion. The female nourishes sperm and
              maintains them in these permanent storage organs for her entire
              life. When she is ready, the female coordinates the release of
              sperm with ovulation, and the descending egg is fertilized.
              Although this process has been well studied via microscopy, many
              questions remain regarding the molecular processes that
              coordinate sperm motility, movement through the reproductive
              tract, maintenance, and usage. In this review, we describe the
              current understanding of a mosquito sperm's journey to the egg,
              highlighting gaps in our knowledge of mosquito reproductive
              biology. Where insufficient information is available in
              mosquitoes, we describe analogous processes in other organisms,
              such as Drosophila melanogaster, as a basis for comparison, and
              we suggest future areas of research that will illuminate how
              sperm successfully traverse the female reproductive tract. Such
              studies may yield molecular targets that could be manipulated to
              control populations of vector species. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 83:

              comprehensively tested and compared four RNA-seq pipelines for
              accuracy of gene quantification and fold-change estimation. We
              used a novel total RNA benchmarking dataset in which small
              non-coding RNAs are highly represented along with other long
              RNAs. The four RNA-seq pipelines consisted of two commonly-used

              mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2
              $\times$ 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core

              canonical junctions, STAR can discover non-canonical splices and
              chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping
              full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse

              experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions

               Chicago, IL Understanding disease development, progression and
               response to treatment remains elusive for most types of cancer.
               This is due both to the genetic complexity seen in tumors as
               well as differences in how the surrounding cells and immune
               system respond to the developing tumor. To fully understand all
               aspects of disease progression and response to treatment, a
               systems level approach is needed. We have developed a platform
               that allows for high resolution multi-omics analysis of the
               tumor and its microenvironment. This platform is built upon a
               microfluidic system that enables the production of hundreds of
               thousands to millions of partitioned barcoded reactions. On this
               platform we generate Linked-Reads that allow for the detailed
               resolution of complex structural variant events. To obtain more
               detailed information about tumor heterogeneity and clonal
               structure, we also perform single cell DNA analysis that allows
               for the detection of sub-megabase copy number variants at the
               single cell level.The platform also provides detailed resolution
               of the cells occupying the microenvironment surrounding the
               tumor. Using a combination of single cell gene expression and
               enriched V(D)J B and T cell repertoire analysis, we identify
               cells constituting a tumor, as well as the immune and nonimmune
               cells surrounding the tumor. We also provide single cell
               profiling of the paired antigen receptor chains for both B and T
               cells. As a demonstration, we have performed this analysis on
               three types of tumor samples: metastatic melanoma (MM), primary
               colorectal cancer (CRC) and primary clear cell renal carcinoma
               (CCRC). We are able to identify a clonal expansion in the CCRC
               sample and determine there is no expansion in the CRC sample.
               The combination of these approaches allows for unparalleled
               characterization of disease development, progression and
               response. Citation Format: Sarah Garcia, Rajiv Bharadwaj,

              genomes with parent-child trios",
  author   = "Malinsky, Milan and Simpson, Jared T and Durbin, Richard",
  abstract = "Motivation: Most DNA sequence in diploid organisms is found in
              two copies, one contributed by the mother and the other by the
              father. The high density of differences between the maternally
              and paternally contributed sequences (heterozygous sites) in some
              organisms makes de novo genome assembly very challenging, even
              for algorithms specifically designed to deal with these cases.
              Therefore, various approaches, most commonly inbreeding in the
              laboratory, are used to reduce heterozygosity in genomic data
              prior to assembly. However, many species are not amenable to
              these techniques. Results: We introduce trio-sga, a set of three
              algorithms designed to take advantage of mother-father-offspring
              trio sequencing to facilitate better quality genome assembly in
              organisms with moderate to high levels of heterozygosity. Two of
              the algorithms use haplotype phase information present in the
              trio data to eliminate the majority of heterozygous sites before
              the assembly commences. The third algorithm is designed to reduce
              sequencing costs by enabling the use of parents9 reads in the
              assembly of the genome of the offspring. We test these algorithms
              on a 9simulated trio9 from four haploid datasets, and further
              demonstrate their performance by assembling three highly
              heterozygous Heliconius butterfly genomes. While the
              implementation of trio-sga is tuned towards Illumina-generated
              data, we note that the trio approach to reducing heterozygosity
              is likely to have cross-platform utility for de novo assembly.

              error rates of such technologies, efficient and accurate assembly
              of large repeats and closely related haplotypes remains
              challenging. We address these issues with Canu, a successor of
              Celera Assembler that is specifically designed for noisy
              single-molecule sequences. Canu introduces support for nanopore
              sequencing, halves depth-of-coverage requirements, and improves
              assembly continuity while simultaneously reducing runtime by an
              order of magnitude on large genomes versus Celera Assembler 8.2.
              These advances result from new overlapping and assembly
              algorithms, including an adaptive overlapping strategy based on
              tf-idf weighted MinHash and a sparse assembly graph construction

              decade, thousands of human genomes have been sequenced,
              contributing deeply to biomedical research. In the vast majority
              of cases, these have been analyzed by aligning sequence reads to
              a single reference genome, biasing the resulting analyses, and in
              general, failing to capture sequences novel to a given genome.
              Some de novo assemblies have been constructed free of reference
              bias, but nearly all were constructed by merging homologous loci
              into single ``consensus'' sequences, generally absent from
              nature. These assemblies do not correctly represent the diploid
              biology of an individual. In exactly two cases, true diploid de
              novo assemblies have been made, at great expense. One was
              generated using Sanger sequencing, and one using thousands of
              clone pools. Here, we demonstrate a straightforward and low-cost
              method for creating true diploid de novo assemblies. We make a
              single library from ∼1 ng of high molecular weight DNA, using the

              blocks longer than 2.5 Mb, and scaffolds longer than 15 Mb. Our

              fragments, enabling ordered map construction without
              electrophoretic analysis. The optical mapping system reported
              here is based on our physical characterization of an effect using
              fluid flows developed within tiny, evaporating droplets to
              elongate and fix DNA molecules onto derivatized surfaces. Such
              evaporation-driven molecular fixation produces well elongated
              molecules accessible to restriction endonucleases, and notably,
              DNA polymerase I. We then developed the robotic means to grid DNA
              spots in well defined arrays that are digested and analyzed in
              parallel. To effectively harness this effect for high-throughput
              genome mapping, we developed: (i) machine vision and automatic
              image acquisition techniques to work with fixed, digested
              molecules within gridded samples, and (ii) Bayesian inference
              approaches that are used to analyze machine vision data,
              automatically producing high-resolution restriction maps from
              images of individual DNA molecules. The aggregate significance of
              this work is the development of an integrated system for mapping
              small insert clones allowing biochemical data obtained from
              engineered ensembles of individual molecules to be automatically
              accumulated and analyzed for map construction. These approaches

              Remarkably, in both species, the geographic clines for the major

              obtaining haplotype-resolved human genomes, a range of new
              sequencing protocols and technologies have been developed to
              enable the reconstruction of whole-genome haplotypes. However,
              existing computational methods designed to handle specific
              technologies do not scale well on data from different protocols.
              We describe a new algorithm, HapCUT2, that extends our previous
              method (HapCUT) to handle multiple sequencing technologies. Using
              simulations and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from multiple
              different data types-dilution pool sequencing, linked-read
              sequencing, single molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing, and
              proximity ligation (Hi-C) sequencing-we show that HapCUT2 rapidly
              assembles haplotypes with best-in-class accuracy for all data
              types. In particular, HapCUT2 scales well for high sequencing
              coverage and rapidly assembled haplotypes for two long-read WGS

              significant improvements in error rates compared to HapCUT, the
              only other method that could assemble haplotypes from Hi-C data.
              Using HapCUT2, haplotype assembly from a 90$\times$ coverage
              whole-genome Hi-C data set yielded high-resolution haplotypes
              (78.6\% of variants phased in a single block) with high pairwise

              belonging to each copy, are crucial for downstream analyses in

              oblivious to direct read information, constitute the
              state-of-the-art. Haplotype assembly, which addresses phasing
              directly from sequencing reads, suffers from the fact that
              sequencing reads of the current generation are too short to serve
              the purposes of genome-wide phasing. While future-technology

              long read lengths (5-50 kbp) at such high error rates (between
              ∼5\% and 40\% error). With this new method, we were able to
              perform a hybrid error correction of the nanopore reads using
              complementary MiSeq data and produce a de novo assembly that is
              highly contiguous and accurate: The contig N50 length is more
              than ten times greater than an Illumina-only assembly (678 kb
              versus 59.9 kbp) and has >99.88\% consensus identity when
              compared to the reference. Furthermore, the assembly with the
              long nanopore reads presents a much more complete representation
              of the features of the genome and correctly assembles gene
              cassettes, rRNAs, transposable elements, and other genomic
              features that were almost entirely absent in the Illumina-only

              genomes with parent-child trios",
  author   = "Malinsky, Milan and Simpson, Jared T and Durbin, Richard",
  abstract = "Motivation: Most DNA sequence in diploid organisms is found in
              two copies, one contributed by the mother and the other by the
              father. The high density of differences between the maternally
              and paternally contributed sequences (heterozygous sites) in some
              organisms makes de novo genome assembly very challenging, even
              for algorithms specifically designed to deal with these cases.
              Therefore, various approaches, most commonly inbreeding in the
              laboratory, are used to reduce heterozygosity in genomic data
              prior to assembly. However, many species are not amenable to
              these techniques. Results: We introduce trio-sga, a set of three
              algorithms designed to take advantage of mother-father-offspring
              trio sequencing to facilitate better quality genome assembly in
              organisms with moderate to high levels of heterozygosity. Two of
              the algorithms use haplotype phase information present in the
              trio data to eliminate the majority of heterozygous sites before
              the assembly commences. The third algorithm is designed to reduce
              sequencing costs by enabling the use of parents9 reads in the
              assembly of the genome of the offspring. We test these algorithms
              on a 9simulated trio9 from four haploid datasets, and further
              demonstrate their performance by assembling three highly
              heterozygous Heliconius butterfly genomes. While the
              implementation of trio-sga is tuned towards Illumina-generated
              data, we note that the trio approach to reducing heterozygosity
              is likely to have cross-platform utility for de novo assembly.

              long reads with uniform coverage and high consensus accuracy,
              making it a powerful technology for de novo genome assembly.
              Improvements in throughput and concomitant reductions in cost
              have made PacBio an attractive core technology for many large
              genome initiatives, however, relatively high DNA input
              requirements (~5 µg for standard library protocol) have placed
              PacBio out of reach for many projects on small organisms that
              have lower DNA content, or on projects with limited input DNA for
              other reasons. Here we present a high-quality de novo genome
              assembly from a single Anopheles coluzzii mosquito. A modified
              SMRTbell library construction protocol without DNA shearing and
              size selection was used to generate a SMRTbell library from just
              100 ng of starting genomic DNA. The sample was run on the Sequel
              System with chemistry 3.0 and software v6.0, generating, on
              average, 25 Gb of sequence per SMRT Cell with 20 h movies,
              followed by diploid de novo genome assembly with FALCON-Unzip.
              The resulting curated assembly had high contiguity (contig N50
              3.5 Mb) and completeness (more than 98\% of conserved genes were
              present and full-length). In addition, this single-insect
              assembly now places 667 (>90\%) of formerly unplaced genes into
              their appropriate chromosomal contexts in the AgamP4 PEST
              reference. We were also able to resolve maternal and paternal
              haplotypes for over 1/3 of the genome. By sequencing and
              assembling material from a single diploid individual, only two
              haplotypes were present, simplifying the assembly process
              compared to samples from multiple pooled individuals. The method
              presented here can be applied to samples with starting DNA
              amounts as low as 100 ng per 1 Gb genome size. This new low-input
              approach puts PacBio-based assemblies in reach for small highly

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: RNAs can be physically classified into poly(A)+ or
              poly(A)- transcripts according to the presence or absence of a
              poly(A) tail at their 3' ends. Current deep sequencing approaches
              largely depend on the enrichment of transcripts with a poly(A)
              tail, and therefore offer little insight into the nature and
              expression of transcripts that lack poly(A) tails. RESULTS: We
              have used deep sequencing to explore the repertoire of both
              poly(A)+ and poly(A)- RNAs from HeLa cells and H9 human embryonic
              stem cells (hESCs). Using stringent criteria, we found that while
              the majority of transcripts are poly(A)+, a significant portion
              of transcripts are either poly(A)- or bimorphic, being found in
              both the poly(A)+ and poly(A)- populations. Further analyses
              revealed that many mRNAs may not contain classical long poly(A)
              tails and such messages are overrepresented in specific
              functional categories. In addition, we surprisingly found that a
              few excised introns accumulate in cells and thus constitute a new
              class of non-polyadenylated long non-coding RNAs. Finally, we
              have identified a specific subset of poly(A)- histone mRNAs,
              including two histone H1 variants, that are expressed in
              undifferentiated hESCs and are rapidly diminished upon
              differentiation; further, these same histone genes are induced
              upon reprogramming of fibroblasts to induced pluripotent stem
              cells. CONCLUSIONS: We offer a rich source of data that allows a
              deeper exploration of the poly(A)- landscape of the eukaryotic
              transcriptome. The approach we present here also applies to the
              analysis of the poly(A)- transcriptomes of other organisms.",

  abstract  = "The genomes of large multicellular eukaryotes are mostly
               comprised of non-protein coding DNA. Although there has been
               much agreement that a small fraction of these genomes has
               important biological functions, there has been much debate as to
               whether the rest contributes to development and/or homeostasis.
               Much of the speculation has centered on the genomic regions that
               are transcribed into RNA at some low level. Unfortunately these
               RNAs have been arbitrarily assigned various names, such as
               ``intergenic RNA,'' ``long non-coding RNAs'' etc., which have
               led to some confusion in the field. Many researchers believe
               that these transcripts represent a vast, unchartered world of
               functional non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), simply because they exist.
               However, there are reasons to question this Panglossian view
               because it ignores our current understanding of how evolution
               shapes eukaryotic genomes and how the gene expression machinery
               works in eukaryotic cells. Although there are undoubtedly many
               more functional ncRNAs yet to be discovered and characterized,
               it is also likely that many of these transcripts are simply
               junk. Here, we discuss how to determine whether any given ncRNA
               has a function. Importantly, we advocate that in the absence of
               any such data, the appropriate null hypothesis is that the RNA

              conversion of adenosine to inosine in double-stranded RNA which

              The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) is one of the most
              popular and fundamental alignment tools. The explosive growth of
              biological sequences calls for speedup of sequence alignment
              tools such as BLAST. To this end, we develop high speed BLASTN
              (HS-BLASTN), a parallel and fast nucleotide database search tool
              that accelerates MegaBLAST--the default module of NCBI-BLASTN.
              HS-BLASTN builds a new lookup table using the FMD-index of the
              database and employs an accurate and effective seeding method to
              find short stretches of identities (called seeds) between the
              query and the database. HS-BLASTN produces the same alignment
              results as MegaBLAST and its computational speed is much faster
              than MegaBLAST. Specifically, our experiments conducted on a
              12-core server show that HS-BLASTN can be 22 times faster than
              MegaBLAST and exhibits better parallel performance than
              MegaBLAST. HS-BLASTN is written in C++ and the related source

  abstract = "MOTIVATION: Matches to repetitive sequences are usually
              undesirable in the output of DNA database searches. Repetitive
              sequences need not be matched to a query, if they can be masked
              in the database. RepeatMasker/Maskeraid (RM), currently the most
              widely used software for DNA sequence masking, is slow and
              requires a library of repetitive template sequences, such as a
              manually curated RepBase library, that may not exist for newly
              sequenced genomes. RESULTS: We have developed a software tool
              called WindowMasker (WM) that identifies and masks highly
              repetitive DNA sequences in a genome, using only the sequence of
              the genome itself. WM is orders of magnitude faster than RM
              because WM uses a few linear-time scans of the genome sequence,
              rather than local alignment methods that compare each library
              sequence with each piece of the genome. We validate WM by
              comparing BLAST outputs from large sets of queries applied to two
              versions of the same genome, one masked by WM, and the other
              masked by RM. Even for genomes such as the human genome, where a
              good RepBase library is available, searching the database as
              masked with WM yields more matches that are apparently
              non-repetitive and fewer matches to repetitive sequences. We show
              that these results hold for transcribed regions as well. WM also
              performs well on genomes for which much of the sequence was in
              draft form at the time of the analysis. AVAILABILITY: WM is
              included in the NCBI C++ toolkit. The source code for the entire
              toolkit is available at

              ultra-long reads of ?100 kilo bases (kb) in average, full-length
              mRNA or cDNA reads in high throughput and genomic contigs over
              100 mega bases (Mb) in length. Existing alignment programs are
              unable or inefficient to process such data at scale, which
              presses for the development of new alignment algorithms. Results:
              Minimap2 is a general-purpose alignment program to map DNA or
              long mRNA sequences against a large reference database. It works
              with accurate short reads of $\geq$ 100bp in length, $\geq$1kb
              genomic reads at error rate ?15\%, full-length noisy Direct RNA
              or cDNA reads, and assembly contigs or closely related full
              chromosomes of hundreds of megabases in length. Minimap2 does
              split-read alignment, employs concave gap cost for long
              insertions and deletions (INDELs) and introduces new heuristics
              to reduce spurious alignments. It is 3-4 times as fast as
              mainstream short-read mappers at comparable accuracy, and is
              $\geq$30 times faster than long-read genomic or cDNA mappers at
              higher accuracy, surpassing most aligners specialized in one type
              of alignment. Availability and implementation:

  abstract = "Summary Arthropods comprise the largest and most diverse phylum
              on Earth and play vital roles in nearly every ecosystem. Their
              diversity stems in part from variations on a conserved body plan,
              resulting from and recorded in adaptive changes in the genome.
              Dissection of the genomic record of sequence change enables broad
              questions regarding genome evolution to be addressed, even across
              hyper-diverse taxa within arthropods. Using 76 whole genome
              sequences representing 21 orders spanning more than 500 million
              years of arthropod evolution, we document changes in gene and
              protein domain content and provide temporal and phylogenetic
              context for interpreting these innovations. We identify many
              novel gene families that arose early in the evolution of
              arthropods and during the diversification of insects into modern
              orders. We reveal unexpected variation in patterns of DNA
              methylation across arthropods and examples of gene family and
              protein domain evolution coincident with the appearance of
              notable phenotypic and physiological adaptations such as flight,
              metamorphosis, sociality and chemoperception. These analyses
              demonstrate how large-scale comparative genomics can provide
              broad new insights into the genotype to phenotype map and
              generate testable hypotheses about the evolution of animal

              species should be associated with genomic regions protected from
              recombination, there are few data to support this theory. The
              malaria mosquito, Anopheles gambiae, is known for its sympatric
              cryptic species maintained by pre-mating reproductive isolation
              and its putative genomic islands of speciation, and is therefore
              an ideal model system for studying the genomic signature
              associated with incipient sympatric speciation. Here we
              selectively introgressed the island of divergence located in the
              pericentric region of the X chromosome of An. gambiae s.s. into
              its sister taxon An. coluzzii through 5 generations of
              backcrossing followed by two generations of crosses within the
              introgressed strains that resulted in An. coluzzii-like

              chromosome island. The mating preference of recombinant strains
              was then tested by giving virgin recombinant individuals a choice
              of mates with X-islands matching and non-matching their own
              island type. We show through genetic analyses of transferred
              sperm that recombinant females consistently mated with matching
              island-type males thereby associating assortative mating genes
              with the X-island of divergence. Furthermore, full-genome

              showed that a number of these unique differences were conserved
              in sympatric field populations, thereby revealing candidate
              speciation genes. The functional demonstration of a close
              association between speciation genes and the X-island of
              differentiation lends unprecedented support to

  abstract  = "\#\#\# INTRODUCTION Control of mosquito vectors has historically
               proven to be an effective means of eliminating malaria. Human
               malaria is transmitted only by mosquitoes in the genus Anopheles
               , but not all species within the genus, or even all members of
               each vector species, are efficient malaria vectors. Variation in
               vectorial capacity for human malaria among Anopheles mosquito
               species is determined by many factors, including behavior,
               immunity, and life history. \#\#\# RATIONALE This variation in
               vectorial capacity suggests an underlying genetic/genomic
               plasticity that results in variation of key traits determining
               vectorial capacity within the genus. Sequencing the genome of
               Anopheles gambiae , the most important malaria vector in
               sub-Saharan Africa, has offered numerous insights into how that
               species became highly specialized to live among and feed upon
               humans and how susceptibility to mosquito control strategies is
               determined. Until very recently, similar genomic resources have
               not existed for other anophelines, limiting comparisons to
               individual genes or sets of genomic markers with no genome-wide
               data to investigate attributes associated with vectorial
               capacity across the genus. \#\#\# RESULTS We sequenced and
               assembled the genomes and transcriptomes of 16 anophelines from
               Africa, Asia, Europe, and Latin America, spanning ~100 million
               years of evolution and chosen to represent a range of
               evolutionary distances from An. gambiae , a variety of
               geographic locations and ecological conditions, and varying
               degrees of vectorial capacity. Genome assembly quality reflected
               DNA template quality and homozygosity. Despite variation in
               contiguity, the assemblies were remarkably complete and searches
               for arthropod-wide single-copy orthologs generally revealed few
               missing genes. Genome annotation supported with RNA sequencing
               transcriptomes yielded between 10,738 and 16,149 protein-coding
               genes for each species. Relative to Drosophila, the closest
               dipteran genus for which equivalent genomic resources exist,
               Anopheles exhibits a dynamic genomic evolutionary profile.
               Comparative analyses show a fivefold faster rate of gene gain
               and loss, elevated gene shuffling on the X chromosome, and more
               intron losses in Anopheles . Some determinants of vectorial
               capacity, such as chemosensory genes, do not show elevated
               turnover but instead diversify through protein-sequence changes.
               We also document evidence of variation in important reproductive
               phenotypes, genes controlling immunity to Plasmodium malaria
               parasites and other microbes, genes encoding cuticular and
               salivary proteins, and genes conferring metabolic insecticide
               resistance. This dynamism of anopheline genes and genomes may
               contribute to their flexible capacity to take advantage of new
               ecological niches, including adapting to humans as primary
               hosts. \#\#\# CONCLUSIONS Anopheline mosquitoes exhibit a
               molecular evolutionary profile very distinct from Drosophila ,
               and their genomes harbor strong evidence of functional variation
               in traits that determine vectorial capacity. These 16 new
               reference genome assemblies provide a foundation for hypothesis
               generation and testing to further our understanding of the
               diverse biological traits that determine vectorial capacity.

               all sequenced anophelines and two mosquito outgroups was

               names indicate vector status and are colored according to
               geographic ranges depicted on the map. Variation in vectorial
               capacity for human malaria among Anopheles mosquito species is
               determined by many factors, including behavior, immunity, and
               life history. To investigate the genomic basis of vectorial
               capacity and explore new avenues for vector control, we
               sequenced the genomes of 16 anopheline mosquito species from
               diverse locations spanning ~100 million years of evolution.
               Comparative analyses show faster rates of gene gain and loss,
               elevated gene shuffling on the X chromosome, and more intron
               losses, relative to Drosophila . Some determinants of vectorial
               capacity, such as chemosensory genes, do not show elevated
               turnover but instead diversify through protein-sequence changes.
               This dynamism of anopheline genes and genomes may contribute to
               their flexible capacity to take advantage of new ecological
               niches, including adapting to humans as primary hosts. Virtually
               everyone has first-hand experience with mosquitoes. Few
               recognize the subtle biological distinctions among these
               bloodsucking flies that render some bites mere nuisances and
               others the initiation of a potentially life-threatening
               infection. By sequencing the genomes of several mosquitoes in
               depth, Neafsey et al. and Fontaine et al. reveal clues that
               explain the mystery of why only some species of one genus of
               mosquitoes are capable of transmitting human malaria (see the

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Heterochromatin plays an important role in chromosome
              function and gene regulation. Despite the availability of
              polytene chromosomes and genome sequence, the heterochromatin of
              the major malaria vector Anopheles gambiae has not been mapped
              and characterized. RESULTS: To determine the extent of
              heterochromatin within the An. gambiae genome, genes were
              physically mapped to the euchromatin-heterochromatin transition
              zone of polytene chromosomes. The study found that a minimum of
              232 genes reside in 16.6 Mb of mapped heterochromatin. Gene
              ontology analysis revealed that heterochromatin is enriched in
              genes with DNA-binding and regulatory activities. Immunostaining
              of the An. gambiae chromosomes with antibodies against Drosophila
              melanogaster heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) and the nuclear
              envelope protein lamin Dm0 identified the major invariable sites
              of the proteins' localization in all regions of pericentric
              heterochromatin, diffuse intercalary heterochromatin, and
              euchromatic region 9C of the 2R arm, but not in the compact
              intercalary heterochromatin. To better understand the molecular
              differences among chromatin types, novel Bayesian statistical
              models were developed to analyze genome features. The study found
              that heterochromatin and euchromatin differ in gene density and
              the coverage of retroelements and segmental duplications. The
              pericentric heterochromatin had the highest coverage of
              retroelements and tandem repeats, while intercalary
              heterochromatin was enriched with segmental duplications. We also
              provide evidence that the diffuse intercalary heterochromatin has
              a higher coverage of DNA transposable elements, minisatellites,
              and satellites than does the compact intercalary heterochromatin.
              The investigation of 42-Mb assembly of unmapped genomic scaffolds
              showed that it has molecular characteristics similar to
              cytologically mapped heterochromatin. CONCLUSIONS: Our results
              demonstrate that Anopheles polytene chromosomes and whole-genome
              shotgun assembly render the mapping and characterization of a
              significant part of heterochromatic scaffolds a possibility.
              These results reveal the strong association between
              characteristics of the genome features and morphological types of
              chromatin. Initial analysis of the An. gambiae heterochromatin
              provides a framework for its functional characterization and
              comparative genomic analyses with other organisms.",

              scaffolding technologies is accelerating the production of
              reference-quality assemblies for large eukaryotic genomes.
              However, haplotype divergence in regions of high heterozygosity
              often results in assemblers creating two copies rather than one
              copy of a region, leading to breaks in contiguity and
              compromising downstream steps such as gene annotation. Several
              tools have been developed to resolve this problem. However, they
              either focus only on removing contained duplicate regions, also
              known as haplotigs, or fail to use all the relevant information
              and hence make errors. RESULTS: Here we present a novel tool,
              purge\_dups, that uses sequence similarity and read depth to
              automatically identify and remove both haplotigs and heterozygous
              overlaps. In comparison with current tools, we demonstrate that

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Recent developments in third-gen long read sequencing
              and diploid-aware assemblers have resulted in the rapid release
              of numerous reference-quality assemblies for diploid genomes.
              However, assembly of highly heterozygous genomes is still
              problematic when regional heterogeneity is so high that haplotype
              homology is not recognised during assembly. This results in
              regional duplication rather than consolidation into allelic
              variants and can cause issues with downstream analysis, for
              example variant discovery, or haplotype reconstruction using the
              diploid assembly with unpaired allelic contigs. RESULTS: A new
              pipeline-Purge Haplotigs-was developed specifically for third-gen
              sequencing-based assemblies to automate the reassignment of
              allelic contigs, and to assist in the manual curation of genome
              assemblies. The pipeline uses a draft haplotype-fused assembly or
              a diploid assembly, read alignments, and repeat annotations to
              identify allelic variants in the primary assembly. The pipeline
              was tested on a simulated dataset and on four recent diploid
              (phased) de novo assemblies from third-generation long-read
              sequencing, and compared with a similar tool. After processing
              with Purge Haplotigs, haploid assemblies were less duplicated
              with minimal impact on genome completeness, and diploid
              assemblies had more pairings of allelic contigs. CONCLUSIONS:
              Purge Haplotigs improves the haploid and diploid representations
              of third-gen sequencing based genome assemblies by identifying
              and reassigning allelic contigs. The implementation is fast and
              scales well with large genomes, and it is less likely to
              over-purge repetitive or paralogous elements compared to
              alignment-only based methods. The software is available at

              However, the lack of a high-quality reference genome has hindered
              the association of phenotypic traits with their genetic basis in
              this important mosquito. FINDINGS: Here we present a new
              high-quality A. funestus reference genome (AfunF3) assembled
              using 240$\times$ coverage of long-read single-molecule
              sequencing for contigging, combined with 100$\times$ coverage of
              short-read Hi-C data for chromosome scaffolding. The assembled
              contigs total 446 Mbp of sequence and contain substantial
              duplication due to alternative alleles present in the sequenced
              pool of mosquitos from the FUMOZ colony. Using alignment and
              depth-of-coverage information, these contigs were deduplicated to
              a 211 Mbp primary assembly, which is closer to the expected
              haploid genome size of 250 Mbp. This primary assembly consists of
              1,053 contigs organized into 3 chromosome-scale scaffolds with an

              We recently sequenced the genomes of two strains of E. anophelis,
              R26T and Ag1, isolated from different strains of A. gambiae. The
              two bacterial strains are identical with a few exceptions.
              Phylogenetically, Elizabethkingia is closer to Chryseobacterium
              and Riemerella than to Flavobacterium. In line with other
              Bacteroidetes known to utilize various polymers in their
              ecological niches, the E. anophelis genome contains numerous TonB
              dependent transporters with various substrate specificities. In
              addition, several genes belonging to the polysaccharide
              utilization system and the glycoside hydrolase family were
              identified that could potentially be of benefit for the mosquito
              carbohydrate metabolism. In agreement with previous reports of
              broad antibiotic resistance in E. anophelis, a large number of
              genes encoding efflux pumps and $\beta$-lactamases are present in
              the genome. The component genes of resistance-nodulation-division
              type efflux pumps were found to be syntenic and conserved in
              different taxa of Bacteroidetes. The bacterium also displays
              hemolytic activity and encodes several hemolysins that may
              participate in the digestion of erythrocytes in the mosquito gut.
              At the same time, the OxyR regulon and antioxidant genes could
              provide defense against the oxidative stress that is associated

  abstract = "MOTIVATION: Testing for correlations between different sets of
              genomic features is a fundamental task in genomics research.
              However, searching for overlaps between features with existing
              web-based methods is complicated by the massive datasets that are
              routinely produced with current sequencing technologies. Fast and
              flexible tools are therefore required to ask complex questions of
              these data in an efficient manner. RESULTS: This article
              introduces a new software suite for the comparison, manipulation
              and annotation of genomic features in Browser Extensible Data
              (BED) and General Feature Format (GFF) format. BEDTools also
              supports the comparison of sequence alignments in BAM format to
              both BED and GFF features. The tools are extremely efficient and
              allow the user to compare large datasets (e.g. next-generation
              sequencing data) with both public and custom genome annotation
              tracks. BEDTools can be combined with one another as well as with
              standard UNIX commands, thus facilitating routine genomics tasks
              as well as pipelines that can quickly answer intricate questions
              of large genomic datasets. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION:
              BEDTools was written in C++. Source code and a comprehensive user

              diploid genome assemblies",
  author   = "Roach, Michael J and Schmidt, Simon A and Borneman, Anthony R",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Recent developments in third-gen long read sequencing
              and diploid-aware assemblers have resulted in the rapid release
              of numerous reference-quality assemblies for diploid genomes.
              However, assembly of highly heterozygous genomes is still
              problematic when regional heterogeneity is so high that haplotype
              homology is not recognised during assembly. This results in
              regional duplication rather than consolidation into allelic
              variants and can cause issues with downstream analysis, for
              example variant discovery, or haplotype reconstruction using the
              diploid assembly with unpaired allelic contigs. RESULTS: A new
              pipeline-Purge Haplotigs-was developed specifically for third-gen
              sequencing-based assemblies to automate the reassignment of
              allelic contigs, and to assist in the manual curation of genome
              assemblies. The pipeline uses a draft haplotype-fused assembly or
              a diploid assembly, read alignments, and repeat annotations to
              identify allelic variants in the primary assembly. The pipeline
              was tested on a simulated dataset and on four recent diploid
              (phased) de novo assemblies from third-generation long-read
              sequencing, and compared with a similar tool. After processing
              with Purge Haplotigs, haploid assemblies were less duplicated
              with minimal impact on genome completeness, and diploid
              assemblies had more pairings of allelic contigs. CONCLUSIONS:
              Purge Haplotigs improves the haploid and diploid representations
              of third-gen sequencing based genome assemblies by identifying
              and reassigning allelic contigs. The implementation is fast and
              scales well with large genomes, and it is less likely to
              over-purge repetitive or paralogous elements compared to
              alignment-only based methods. The software is available at
              https://bitbucket.org/mroachawri/purge\_haplotigs under a

              scaffolds with no chromosomal location, no sequence data for the
              Y chromosome, haplotype polymorphisms resulting in two different
              genome assemblies in limited regions and contaminating bacterial
              DNA. RESULTS: Polytene chromosome in situ hybridization with cDNA
              clones was used to place 15 unmapped scaffolds (sizes totaling
              5.34 Mbp) in the pericentromeric regions of the chromosomes and
              oriented a further 9 scaffolds. Additional analysis by in situ
              hybridization of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones
              placed 1.32 Mbp (5 scaffolds) in the physical gaps between
              scaffolds on euchromatic parts of the chromosomes. The Y
              chromosome sequence information (0.18 Mbp) remains highly
              incomplete and fragmented among 55 short scaffolds. Analysis of
              BAC end sequences showed that 22 inter-scaffold gaps were spanned
              by BAC clones. Unmapped scaffolds were also aligned to the
              chromosome assemblies in silico, identifying regions totaling
              8.18 Mbp (144 scaffolds) that are probably represented in the
              genome project by two alternative assemblies. An additional 3.53
              Mbp of alternative assembly was identified within mapped
              scaffolds. Scaffolds comprising 1.97 Mbp (679 small scaffolds)
              were identified as probably derived from contaminating bacterial
              DNA. In total, about 33\% of previously unmapped sequences were

  abstract  = "\#\#\# INTRODUCTION Control of mosquito vectors has historically
               proven to be an effective means of eliminating malaria. Human
               malaria is transmitted only by mosquitoes in the genus Anopheles
               , but not all species within the genus, or even all members of
               each vector species, are efficient malaria vectors. Variation in
               vectorial capacity for human malaria among Anopheles mosquito
               species is determined by many factors, including behavior,
               immunity, and life history. \#\#\# RATIONALE This variation in
               vectorial capacity suggests an underlying genetic/genomic
               plasticity that results in variation of key traits determining
               vectorial capacity within the genus. Sequencing the genome of
               Anopheles gambiae , the most important malaria vector in
               sub-Saharan Africa, has offered numerous insights into how that
               species became highly specialized to live among and feed upon
               humans and how susceptibility to mosquito control strategies is
               determined. Until very recently, similar genomic resources have
               not existed for other anophelines, limiting comparisons to
               individual genes or sets of genomic markers with no genome-wide
               data to investigate attributes associated with vectorial
               capacity across the genus. \#\#\# RESULTS We sequenced and
               assembled the genomes and transcriptomes of 16 anophelines from
               Africa, Asia, Europe, and Latin America, spanning ~100 million
               years of evolution and chosen to represent a range of
               evolutionary distances from An. gambiae , a variety of
               geographic locations and ecological conditions, and varying
               degrees of vectorial capacity. Genome assembly quality reflected
               DNA template quality and homozygosity. Despite variation in
               contiguity, the assemblies were remarkably complete and searches
               for arthropod-wide single-copy orthologs generally revealed few
               missing genes. Genome annotation supported with RNA sequencing
               transcriptomes yielded between 10,738 and 16,149 protein-coding
               genes for each species. Relative to Drosophila, the closest
               dipteran genus for which equivalent genomic resources exist,
               Anopheles exhibits a dynamic genomic evolutionary profile.
               Comparative analyses show a fivefold faster rate of gene gain
               and loss, elevated gene shuffling on the X chromosome, and more
               intron losses in Anopheles . Some determinants of vectorial
               capacity, such as chemosensory genes, do not show elevated
               turnover but instead diversify through protein-sequence changes.
               We also document evidence of variation in important reproductive
               phenotypes, genes controlling immunity to Plasmodium malaria
               parasites and other microbes, genes encoding cuticular and
               salivary proteins, and genes conferring metabolic insecticide
               resistance. This dynamism of anopheline genes and genomes may
               contribute to their flexible capacity to take advantage of new
               ecological niches, including adapting to humans as primary
               hosts. \#\#\# CONCLUSIONS Anopheline mosquitoes exhibit a
               molecular evolutionary profile very distinct from Drosophila ,
               and their genomes harbor strong evidence of functional variation
               in traits that determine vectorial capacity. These 16 new
               reference genome assemblies provide a foundation for hypothesis
               generation and testing to further our understanding of the
               diverse biological traits that determine vectorial capacity.

               of the 16 newly sequenced anopheline mosquitoes and selected
               other dipterans. The maximum likelihood molecular phylogeny of
               all sequenced anophelines and two mosquito outgroups was
               constructed from the aligned protein sequences of 1085
               single-copy orthologs. Shapes between branch termini and species
               names indicate vector status and are colored according to
               geographic ranges depicted on the map. Variation in vectorial
               capacity for human malaria among Anopheles mosquito species is
               determined by many factors, including behavior, immunity, and
               life history. To investigate the genomic basis of vectorial
               capacity and explore new avenues for vector control, we
               sequenced the genomes of 16 anopheline mosquito species from
               diverse locations spanning ~100 million years of evolution.
               Comparative analyses show faster rates of gene gain and loss,
               elevated gene shuffling on the X chromosome, and more intron
               losses, relative to Drosophila . Some determinants of vectorial
               capacity, such as chemosensory genes, do not show elevated
               turnover but instead diversify through protein-sequence changes.
               This dynamism of anopheline genes and genomes may contribute to
               their flexible capacity to take advantage of new ecological
               niches, including adapting to humans as primary hosts. Virtually
               everyone has first-hand experience with mosquitoes. Few
               recognize the subtle biological distinctions among these
               bloodsucking flies that render some bites mere nuisances and
               others the initiation of a potentially life-threatening
               infection. By sequencing the genomes of several mosquitoes in
               depth, Neafsey et al. and Fontaine et al. reveal clues that
               explain the mystery of why only some species of one genus of
               mosquitoes are capable of transmitting human malaria (see the
               Perspective by Clark and Messer). Science , this issue

  abstract = "Summary Arthropods comprise the largest and most diverse phylum
              on Earth and play vital roles in nearly every ecosystem. Their
              diversity stems in part from variations on a conserved body plan,
              resulting from and recorded in adaptive changes in the genome.
              Dissection of the genomic record of sequence change enables broad
              questions regarding genome evolution to be addressed, even across
              hyper-diverse taxa within arthropods. Using 76 whole genome
              sequences representing 21 orders spanning more than 500 million
              years of arthropod evolution, we document changes in gene and
              protein domain content and provide temporal and phylogenetic
              context for interpreting these innovations. We identify many
              novel gene families that arose early in the evolution of
              arthropods and during the diversification of insects into modern
              orders. We reveal unexpected variation in patterns of DNA
              methylation across arthropods and examples of gene family and
              protein domain evolution coincident with the appearance of
              notable phenotypic and physiological adaptations such as flight,
              metamorphosis, sociality and chemoperception. These analyses
              demonstrate how large-scale comparative genomics can provide
              broad new insights into the genotype to phenotype map and
              generate testable hypotheses about the evolution of animal
              diversity.",

  abstract = "Female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes infect more than 400 million
              people each year with dangerous viral pathogens including dengue,
              yellow fever, Zika and chikungunya. Progress in understanding the
              biology of mosquitoes and developing the tools to fight them has
              been slowed by the lack of a high-quality genome assembly. Here
              we combine diverse technologies to produce the markedly improved,
              fully re-annotated AaegL5 genome assembly, and demonstrate how it
              accelerates mosquito science. We anchored physical and
              cytogenetic maps, doubled the number of known chemosensory
              ionotropic receptors that guide mosquitoes to human hosts and
              egg-laying sites, provided further insight into the size and
              composition of the sex-determining M locus, and revealed
              copy-number variation among glutathione S-transferase genes that
              are important for insecticide resistance. Using high-resolution
              quantitative trait locus and population genomic analyses, we
              mapped new candidates for dengue vector competence and
              insecticide resistance. AaegL5 will catalyse new biological
              insights and intervention strategies to fight this deadly disease
