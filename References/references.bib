  author        = "Kingma, Diederik P and Ba, Jimmy",
  abstract      = "We introduce Adam, an algorithm for first-order
                   gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective
                   functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order
                   moments. The method is straightforward to implement, is
                   computationally efficient, has little memory requirements,
                   is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is
                   well suited for problems that are large in terms of data
                   and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for
                   non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy
                   and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive
                   interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some
                   connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was
                   inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical
                   convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret
                   bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best
                   known results under the online convex optimization
                   framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works
                   well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic
                   optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant
                   of Adam based on the infinity norm.",

              downstream genomic analyses and are of critical importance.
              Recent genome assembly projects have relied on a combination of
              noisy long-read sequencing and accurate short-read sequencing,
              with the former offering greater assembly continuity and the
              latter providing higher consensus accuracy. The recently
              introduced Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) HiFi sequencing
              technology bridges this divide by delivering long reads (>10 kbp)
              with high per-base accuracy (>99.9\%). Here we present HiCanu, a
              modification of the Canu assembler designed to leverage the full
              potential of HiFi reads via homopolymer compression,
              overlap-based error correction, and aggressive false overlap
              filtering. We benchmark HiCanu with a focus on the recovery of
              haplotype diversity, major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
              variants, satellite DNAs, and segmental duplications. For diploid
              human genomes sequenced to 30$\times$ HiFi coverage, HiCanu
              achieved superior accuracy and allele recovery compared to the
              current state of the art. On the effectively haploid CHM13 human
              cell line, HiCanu achieved an NG50 contig size of 77 Mbp with a
              per-base consensus accuracy of 99.999\% (QV50), surpassing recent
              assemblies of high-coverage, ultralong Oxford Nanopore
              Technologies (ONT) reads in terms of both accuracy and
              continuity. This HiCanu assembly correctly resolves 337 out of
              341 validation BACs sampled from known segmental duplications and
              provides the first preliminary assemblies of nine complete human
              centromeric regions. Although gaps and errors still remain within
              the most challenging regions of the genome, these results

              long-read sequencing technologies provides both new challenges
              and potential solutions to the issue. Here, we present
              HaploMerger2 (HM2), an automated pipeline for rebuilding both
              haploid sub-assemblies from the polymorphic diploid genome
              assembly. It is designed to work on pre-existing diploid
              assemblies, which are typically created by using de novo
              assemblers. HM2 can process any diploid assemblies, but it is
              especially suitable for diploid assemblies with high
              heterozygosity ($\geq$3\%), which can be difficult for other
              tools. This pipeline also implements flexible and sensitive
              assembly error detection, a hierarchical scaffolding procedure
              and a reliable gap-closing method for haploid sub-assemblies.
              Using HM2, we demonstrate that two haploid sub-assemblies

              insert of interest, and a single-stranded hairpin loop on either
              end, which provides a site for primer binding. Structurally, this
              format resembles a linear double-stranded molecule, and yet it is

              from both the sense and antisense strands of the insert region.

              hifiasm strives to preserve the contiguity of all haplotypes.
              This feature enables the development of a graph trio binning
              algorithm that greatly advances over standard trio binning. On
              three human and five nonhuman datasets, including California

              detection. Recently, the deep sequence coverage generated by

              sequence to be processed during a genome project to grow rapidly,
              and has rendered current k-mer counting tools too slow and memory

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Haplotype assembly is the process of assigning the
              different alleles of the variants covered by mapped sequencing
              reads to the two haplotypes of the genome of a human individual.
              Long reads, which are nowadays cheaper to produce and more widely
              available than ever before, have been used to reduce the
              fragmentation of the assembled haplotypes since their ability to
              span several variants along the genome. These long reads are also
              characterized by a high error rate, an issue which may be
              mitigated, however, with larger sets of reads, when this error
              rate is uniform across genome positions. Unfortunately, current
              state-of-the-art dynamic programming approaches designed for long
              reads deal only with limited coverages. RESULTS: Here, we propose
              a new method for assembling haplotypes which combines and extends
              the features of previous approaches to deal with long reads and
              higher coverages. In particular, our algorithm is able to
              dynamically adapt the estimated number of errors at each variant
              site, while minimizing the total number of error corrections
              necessary for finding a feasible solution. This allows our method
              to significantly reduce the required computational resources,
              allowing to consider datasets composed of higher coverages. The
              algorithm has been implemented in a freely available tool,
              HapCHAT: Haplotype Assembly Coverage Handling by Adapting
              Thresholds. An experimental analysis on sequencing reads with up
              to 60 $\times$ coverage reveals improvements in accuracy and
              recall achieved by considering a higher coverage with lower
              runtimes. CONCLUSIONS: Our method leverages the long-range
              information of sequencing reads that allows to obtain assembled
              haplotypes fragmented in a lower number of unphased haplotype
              blocks. At the same time, our method is also able to deal with
              higher coverages to better correct the errors in the original
              reads and to obtain more accurate haplotypes as a result.

              different data types-dilution pool sequencing, linked-read
              sequencing, single molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing, and
              proximity ligation (Hi-C) sequencing-we show that HapCUT2 rapidly
              assembles haplotypes with best-in-class accuracy for all data
              types. In particular, HapCUT2 scales well for high sequencing
              coverage and rapidly assembled haplotypes for two long-read WGS
              data sets on which other methods struggled. Further, HapCUT2
              directly models Hi-C specific error modalities, resulting in
              significant improvements in error rates compared to HapCUT, the
              only other method that could assemble haplotypes from Hi-C data.
              Using HapCUT2, haplotype assembly from a 90$\times$ coverage
              whole-genome Hi-C data set yielded high-resolution haplotypes
              (78.6\% of variants phased in a single block) with high pairwise
              phasing accuracy (∼98\% across chromosomes). Our results

              heterozygous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to the two
              copies of the genome. The resulting haplotypes, lists of SNPs
              belonging to each copy, are crucial for downstream analyses in
              population genetics. Currently, statistical approaches, which are
              oblivious to direct read information, constitute the
              state-of-the-art. Haplotype assembly, which addresses phasing
              directly from sequencing reads, suffers from the fact that
              sequencing reads of the current generation are too short to serve
              the purposes of genome-wide phasing. While future-technology
              sequencing reads will contain sufficient amounts of SNPs per read
              for phasing, they are also likely to suffer from higher
              sequencing error rates. Currently, no haplotype assembly
              approaches exist that allow for taking both increasing read
              length and sequencing error information into account. Here, we
              suggest WhatsHap, the first approach that yields provably optimal
              solutions to the weighted minimum error correction problem in
              runtime linear in the number of SNPs. WhatsHap is a fixed
              parameter tractable (FPT) approach with coverage as the
              parameter. We demonstrate that WhatsHap can handle datasets of
              coverage up to 20$\times$, and that 15$\times$ are generally
              enough for reliably phasing long reads, even at significantly
              elevated sequencing error rates. We also find that the switch and
              flip error rates of the haplotypes we output are favorable when

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Heterochromatin plays an important role in chromosome
              function and gene regulation. Despite the availability of
              polytene chromosomes and genome sequence, the heterochromatin of
              the major malaria vector Anopheles gambiae has not been mapped
              and characterized. RESULTS: To determine the extent of
              heterochromatin within the An. gambiae genome, genes were
              physically mapped to the euchromatin-heterochromatin transition
              zone of polytene chromosomes. The study found that a minimum of
              232 genes reside in 16.6 Mb of mapped heterochromatin. Gene
              ontology analysis revealed that heterochromatin is enriched in
              genes with DNA-binding and regulatory activities. Immunostaining
              of the An. gambiae chromosomes with antibodies against Drosophila
              melanogaster heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) and the nuclear
              envelope protein lamin Dm0 identified the major invariable sites
              of the proteins' localization in all regions of pericentric
              heterochromatin, diffuse intercalary heterochromatin, and
              euchromatic region 9C of the 2R arm, but not in the compact
              intercalary heterochromatin. To better understand the molecular
              differences among chromatin types, novel Bayesian statistical
              models were developed to analyze genome features. The study found
              that heterochromatin and euchromatin differ in gene density and
              the coverage of retroelements and segmental duplications. The
              pericentric heterochromatin had the highest coverage of
              retroelements and tandem repeats, while intercalary
              heterochromatin was enriched with segmental duplications. We also
              provide evidence that the diffuse intercalary heterochromatin has
              a higher coverage of DNA transposable elements, minisatellites,
              and satellites than does the compact intercalary heterochromatin.
              The investigation of 42-Mb assembly of unmapped genomic scaffolds
              showed that it has molecular characteristics similar to
              cytologically mapped heterochromatin. CONCLUSIONS: Our results
              demonstrate that Anopheles polytene chromosomes and whole-genome
              shotgun assembly render the mapping and characterization of a
              significant part of heterochromatic scaffolds a possibility.

              clones was used to place 15 unmapped scaffolds (sizes totaling
              5.34 Mbp) in the pericentromeric regions of the chromosomes and
              oriented a further 9 scaffolds. Additional analysis by in situ
              hybridization of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones
              placed 1.32 Mbp (5 scaffolds) in the physical gaps between
              scaffolds on euchromatic parts of the chromosomes. The Y
              chromosome sequence information (0.18 Mbp) remains highly
              incomplete and fragmented among 55 short scaffolds. Analysis of

              since 1991, it had not been epidemic in Haiti for at least 100
              years. Recently, however, there has been a severe outbreak of
              cholera in Haiti. METHODS: We used third-generation
              single-molecule real-time DNA sequencing to determine the genome
              sequences of 2 clinical Vibrio cholerae isolates from the current
              outbreak in Haiti, 1 strain that caused cholera in Latin America
              in 1991, and 2 strains isolated in South Asia in 2002 and 2008.
              Using primary sequence data, we compared the genomes of these 5
              strains and a set of previously obtained partial genomic
              sequences of 23 diverse strains of V. cholerae to assess the
              likely origin of the cholera outbreak in Haiti. RESULTS: Both
              single-nucleotide variations and the presence and structure of
              hypervariable chromosomal elements indicate that there is a close
              relationship between the Haitian isolates and variant V. cholerae
              El Tor O1 strains isolated in Bangladesh in 2002 and 2008. In
              contrast, analysis of genomic variation of the Haitian isolates
              reveals a more distant relationship with circulating South
              American isolates. CONCLUSIONS: The Haitian epidemic is probably
              the result of the introduction, through human activity, of a V.
              cholerae strain from a distant geographic source. (Funded by the

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Recent methods have been developed to perform
              high-throughput sequencing of DNA by Single Molecule Sequencing
              (SMS). While Next-Generation sequencing methods may produce reads
              up to several hundred bases long, SMS sequencing produces reads
              up to tens of kilobases long. Existing alignment methods are
              either too inefficient for high-throughput datasets, or not
              sensitive enough to align SMS reads, which have a higher error
              rate than Next-Generation sequencing. RESULTS: We describe the
              method BLASR (Basic Local Alignment with Successive Refinement)
              for mapping Single Molecule Sequencing (SMS) reads that are
              thousands of bases long, with divergence between the read and
              genome dominated by insertion and deletion error. The method is
              benchmarked using both simulated reads and reads from a bacterial
              sequencing project. We also present a combinatorial model of
              sequencing error that motivates why our approach is effective.
              CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that it is possible to map SMS
              reads with high accuracy and speed. Furthermore, the inferences
              made on the mapability of SMS reads using our combinatorial model
              of sequencing error are in agreement with the mapping accuracy

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Recent developments in third-gen long read sequencing
              and diploid-aware assemblers have resulted in the rapid release
              of numerous reference-quality assemblies for diploid genomes.
              However, assembly of highly heterozygous genomes is still
              problematic when regional heterogeneity is so high that haplotype
              homology is not recognised during assembly. This results in
              regional duplication rather than consolidation into allelic
              variants and can cause issues with downstream analysis, for
              example variant discovery, or haplotype reconstruction using the
              diploid assembly with unpaired allelic contigs. RESULTS: A new
              pipeline-Purge Haplotigs-was developed specifically for third-gen
              sequencing-based assemblies to automate the reassignment of
              allelic contigs, and to assist in the manual curation of genome
              assemblies. The pipeline uses a draft haplotype-fused assembly or
              a diploid assembly, read alignments, and repeat annotations to
              identify allelic variants in the primary assembly. The pipeline
              was tested on a simulated dataset and on four recent diploid
              (phased) de novo assemblies from third-generation long-read
              sequencing, and compared with a similar tool. After processing
              with Purge Haplotigs, haploid assemblies were less duplicated
              with minimal impact on genome completeness, and diploid
              assemblies had more pairings of allelic contigs. CONCLUSIONS:
              Purge Haplotigs improves the haploid and diploid representations
              of third-gen sequencing based genome assemblies by identifying
              and reassigning allelic contigs. The implementation is fast and
              scales well with large genomes, and it is less likely to
              over-purge repetitive or paralogous elements compared to
              alignment-only based methods. The software is available at

              Phylogenetically, Elizabethkingia is closer to Chryseobacterium

               Burrows--Wheeler Transform (BWT), to efficiently align short
               sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the
               human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps. BWA supports both
               base space reads, e.g. from Illumina sequencing machines, and
               color space reads from AB SOLiD machines. Evaluations on both
               simulated and real data suggest that BWA is ∼10--20$\times$
               faster than MAQ, while achieving similar accuracy. In addition,
               BWA outputs alignment in the new standard SAM (Sequence
               Alignment/Map) format. Variant calling and other downstream

              genome assemblers, fast multiple sequence alignment and repeat
              detection. The tremendous amounts of NGS data require fast
              algorithms for k-mer counting, preferably using moderate amounts
              of memory. RESULTS: We present a novel method for k-mer counting,
              on large datasets about twice faster than the strongest
              competitors (Jellyfish 2, KMC 1), using about 12 GB (or less) of

              has increased, it usually does not reconstruct a full chromosome
              or an arm of the chromosome, resulting in an unfinished
              chromosome level assembly. To increase the contiguity of the

              which exploit long range contact information between chromosomes

              efficient scaffolding method that can boost the assembly
              contiguity to a large extent using genome-wide chromatin
              interaction data such as Hi-C. RESULTS: we demonstrate an

              at the site of insemination where they are hyperactivated and
              quickly congregate near the entrance of the spermathecal ducts.
              Within minutes, they travel up the narrow ducts to the
              spermathecae, likely through the combined efforts of female
              transport and sperm locomotion. The female nourishes sperm and
              maintains them in these permanent storage organs for her entire
              life. When she is ready, the female coordinates the release of
              sperm with ovulation, and the descending egg is fertilized.
              Although this process has been well studied via microscopy, many
              questions remain regarding the molecular processes that
              coordinate sperm motility, movement through the reproductive
              tract, maintenance, and usage. In this review, we describe the
              current understanding of a mosquito sperm's journey to the egg,
              highlighting gaps in our knowledge of mosquito reproductive
              biology. Where insufficient information is available in
              mosquitoes, we describe analogous processes in other organisms,
              such as Drosophila melanogaster, as a basis for comparison, and
              we suggest future areas of research that will illuminate how
              sperm successfully traverse the female reproductive tract. Such
              studies may yield molecular targets that could be manipulated to
              control populations of vector species. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 83:

  abstract = "MOTIVATION: Accurate alignment of high-throughput RNA-seq data is
              a challenging and yet unsolved problem because of the
              non-contiguous transcript structure, relatively short read
              lengths and constantly increasing throughput of the sequencing
              technologies. Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from
              high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length
              limitation and mapping biases. RESULTS: To align our large (>80
              billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we developed
              the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software
              based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm
              that uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed
              suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching
              procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor of >50 in
              mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2
              $\times$ 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core
              server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity
              and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of
              canonical junctions, STAR can discover non-canonical splices and
              chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping
              full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse
              transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we
              experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions
              with an 80-90\% success rate, corroborating the high precision of
              the STAR mapping strategy. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: STAR

               Chicago, IL Understanding disease development, progression and
               response to treatment remains elusive for most types of cancer.
               This is due both to the genetic complexity seen in tumors as
               well as differences in how the surrounding cells and immune
               system respond to the developing tumor. To fully understand all
               aspects of disease progression and response to treatment, a
               systems level approach is needed. We have developed a platform
               that allows for high resolution multi-omics analysis of the
               tumor and its microenvironment. This platform is built upon a
               microfluidic system that enables the production of hundreds of
               thousands to millions of partitioned barcoded reactions. On this
               platform we generate Linked-Reads that allow for the detailed
               resolution of complex structural variant events. To obtain more
               detailed information about tumor heterogeneity and clonal
               structure, we also perform single cell DNA analysis that allows
               for the detection of sub-megabase copy number variants at the
               single cell level.The platform also provides detailed resolution
               of the cells occupying the microenvironment surrounding the
               tumor. Using a combination of single cell gene expression and
               enriched V(D)J B and T cell repertoire analysis, we identify
               cells constituting a tumor, as well as the immune and nonimmune
               cells surrounding the tumor. We also provide single cell
               profiling of the paired antigen receptor chains for both B and T
               cells. As a demonstration, we have performed this analysis on
               three types of tumor samples: metastatic melanoma (MM), primary
               colorectal cancer (CRC) and primary clear cell renal carcinoma
               (CCRC). We are able to identify a clonal expansion in the CCRC
               sample and determine there is no expansion in the CRC sample.
               The combination of these approaches allows for unparalleled
               characterization of disease development, progression and
               response. Citation Format: Sarah Garcia, Rajiv Bharadwaj,

              for algorithms specifically designed to deal with these cases.
              Therefore, various approaches, most commonly inbreeding in the
              laboratory, are used to reduce heterozygosity in genomic data
              prior to assembly. However, many species are not amenable to
              these techniques. Results: We introduce trio-sga, a set of three
              algorithms designed to take advantage of mother-father-offspring
              trio sequencing to facilitate better quality genome assembly in
              organisms with moderate to high levels of heterozygosity. Two of
              the algorithms use haplotype phase information present in the
              trio data to eliminate the majority of heterozygous sites before
              the assembly commences. The third algorithm is designed to reduce
              sequencing costs by enabling the use of parents9 reads in the
              assembly of the genome of the offspring. We test these algorithms
              on a 9simulated trio9 from four haploid datasets, and further
              demonstrate their performance by assembling three highly
              heterozygous Heliconius butterfly genomes. While the
              implementation of trio-sga is tuned towards Illumina-generated
              data, we note that the trio approach to reducing heterozygosity
              is likely to have cross-platform utility for de novo assembly.

              assembler. It is available at

              These advances result from new overlapping and assembly

              contributing deeply to biomedical research. In the vast majority
              of cases, these have been analyzed by aligning sequence reads to
              a single reference genome, biasing the resulting analyses, and in
              general, failing to capture sequences novel to a given genome.
              Some de novo assemblies have been constructed free of reference
              bias, but nearly all were constructed by merging homologous loci
              into single ``consensus'' sequences, generally absent from
              nature. These assemblies do not correctly represent the diploid
              biology of an individual. In exactly two cases, true diploid de
              novo assemblies have been made, at great expense. One was
              generated using Sanger sequencing, and one using thousands of
              clone pools. Here, we demonstrate a straightforward and low-cost
              method for creating true diploid de novo assemblies. We make a

              blocks longer than 2.5 Mb, and scaffolds longer than 15 Mb. Our

              obtaining haplotype-resolved human genomes, a range of new
              sequencing protocols and technologies have been developed to
              enable the reconstruction of whole-genome haplotypes. However,
              existing computational methods designed to handle specific
              technologies do not scale well on data from different protocols.
              We describe a new algorithm, HapCUT2, that extends our previous
              method (HapCUT) to handle multiple sequencing technologies. Using
              simulations and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from multiple
              different data types-dilution pool sequencing, linked-read
              sequencing, single molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing, and
              proximity ligation (Hi-C) sequencing-we show that HapCUT2 rapidly
              assembles haplotypes with best-in-class accuracy for all data
              types. In particular, HapCUT2 scales well for high sequencing
              coverage and rapidly assembled haplotypes for two long-read WGS

              significant improvements in error rates compared to HapCUT, the
              only other method that could assemble haplotypes from Hi-C data.
              Using HapCUT2, haplotype assembly from a 90$\times$ coverage
              whole-genome Hi-C data set yielded high-resolution haplotypes
              (78.6\% of variants phased in a single block) with high pairwise

              genomes with parent-child trios",
  author   = "Malinsky, Milan and Simpson, Jared T and Durbin, Richard",
  abstract = "Motivation: Most DNA sequence in diploid organisms is found in
              two copies, one contributed by the mother and the other by the
              father. The high density of differences between the maternally
              and paternally contributed sequences (heterozygous sites) in some
              organisms makes de novo genome assembly very challenging, even
              for algorithms specifically designed to deal with these cases.
              Therefore, various approaches, most commonly inbreeding in the
              laboratory, are used to reduce heterozygosity in genomic data
              prior to assembly. However, many species are not amenable to
              these techniques. Results: We introduce trio-sga, a set of three
              algorithms designed to take advantage of mother-father-offspring
              trio sequencing to facilitate better quality genome assembly in
              organisms with moderate to high levels of heterozygosity. Two of
              the algorithms use haplotype phase information present in the
              trio data to eliminate the majority of heterozygous sites before
              the assembly commences. The third algorithm is designed to reduce
              sequencing costs by enabling the use of parents9 reads in the
              assembly of the genome of the offspring. We test these algorithms
              on a 9simulated trio9 from four haploid datasets, and further
              demonstrate their performance by assembling three highly
              heterozygous Heliconius butterfly genomes. While the
              implementation of trio-sga is tuned towards Illumina-generated
              data, we note that the trio approach to reducing heterozygosity
              is likely to have cross-platform utility for de novo assembly.
              Availability: trio-sga is an extension of the sga genome
              assembler. It is available at

              genomics, and is increasingly important for conservation biology.
              PacBio Single Molecule, Real-Time (SMRT) sequencing generates
              long reads with uniform coverage and high consensus accuracy,
              making it a powerful technology for de novo genome assembly.
              Improvements in throughput and concomitant reductions in cost
              have made PacBio an attractive core technology for many large
              genome initiatives, however, relatively high DNA input
              requirements (~5 µg for standard library protocol) have placed
              PacBio out of reach for many projects on small organisms that
              have lower DNA content, or on projects with limited input DNA for
              other reasons. Here we present a high-quality de novo genome
              assembly from a single Anopheles coluzzii mosquito. A modified
              SMRTbell library construction protocol without DNA shearing and
              size selection was used to generate a SMRTbell library from just
              100 ng of starting genomic DNA. The sample was run on the Sequel
              System with chemistry 3.0 and software v6.0, generating, on
              average, 25 Gb of sequence per SMRT Cell with 20 h movies,
              followed by diploid de novo genome assembly with FALCON-Unzip.
              The resulting curated assembly had high contiguity (contig N50
              3.5 Mb) and completeness (more than 98\% of conserved genes were
              present and full-length). In addition, this single-insect
              assembly now places 667 (>90\%) of formerly unplaced genes into
              their appropriate chromosomal contexts in the AgamP4 PEST
              reference. We were also able to resolve maternal and paternal
              haplotypes for over 1/3 of the genome. By sequencing and
              assembling material from a single diploid individual, only two
              haplotypes were present, simplifying the assembly process
              compared to samples from multiple pooled individuals. The method
              presented here can be applied to samples with starting DNA
              amounts as low as 100 ng per 1 Gb genome size. This new low-input
              approach puts PacBio-based assemblies in reach for small highly

              cell identity and function, but limitations of ease and scale
              have prevented its broad application. Here we describe Drop-seq,
              a strategy for quickly profiling thousands of individual cells by
              separating them into nanoliter-sized aqueous droplets,
              associating a different barcode with each cell's RNAs, and
              sequencing them all together. Drop-seq analyzes mRNA transcripts
              from thousands of individual cells simultaneously while
              remembering transcripts' cell of origin. We analyzed
              transcriptomes from 44,808 mouse retinal cells and identified 39
              transcriptionally distinct cell populations, creating a molecular
              atlas of gene expression for known retinal cell classes and novel
              candidate cell subtypes. Drop-seq will accelerate biological
              discovery by enabling routine transcriptional profiling at
              single-cell resolution. VIDEO ABSTRACT.",

              maternal cells. Trophoblast--decidual interactions underlie
              common diseases of pregnancy, including pre-eclampsia and
              stillbirth. Here we profile the transcriptomes of about 70,000
              single cells from first-trimester placentas with matched maternal
              blood and decidual cells. The cellular composition of human

              are located in distinct decidual layers. There are three major
              subsets of decidual natural killer cells that have distinctive
              immunomodulatory and chemokine profiles. We develop a repository
              of ligand--receptor complexes and a statistical tool to predict

              the conservation of endangered species and ecosystems, and the
              preservation and enhancement of ecosystem services. We describe

              and protein diversity, which is not directly encoded in the
              genome. The most common type of RNA editing in vertebrates is the
              conversion of adenosine to inosine in double-stranded RNA which
              occurs in the higher eukaryotes. This editing is carried out by
              the family of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) proteins.
              The most-studied substrates of ADAR proteins undergo editing
              which is very consistent, highly conserved, and functionally
              important. However, editing causes changes in protein-coding
              regions only at a small proportion of all editing sites. The vast
              majority of editing sites are in noncoding sequences. This
              includes microRNAs, as well as the introns and 3' untranslated
              regions of messenger RNAs, which play important roles in the

  abstract = "Sequence alignment is a long standing problem in bioinformatics.
              The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) is one of the most
              popular and fundamental alignment tools. The explosive growth of
              biological sequences calls for speedup of sequence alignment
              tools such as BLAST. To this end, we develop high speed BLASTN
              (HS-BLASTN), a parallel and fast nucleotide database search tool
              that accelerates MegaBLAST--the default module of NCBI-BLASTN.
              HS-BLASTN builds a new lookup table using the FMD-index of the
              database and employs an accurate and effective seeding method to
              find short stretches of identities (called seeds) between the
              query and the database. HS-BLASTN produces the same alignment
              results as MegaBLAST and its computational speed is much faster
              than MegaBLAST. Specifically, our experiments conducted on a
              12-core server show that HS-BLASTN can be 22 times faster than
              MegaBLAST and exhibits better parallel performance than
              MegaBLAST. HS-BLASTN is written in C++ and the related source

  abstract = "MOTIVATION: Matches to repetitive sequences are usually
              undesirable in the output of DNA database searches. Repetitive
              sequences need not be matched to a query, if they can be masked
              in the database. RepeatMasker/Maskeraid (RM), currently the most
              widely used software for DNA sequence masking, is slow and
              requires a library of repetitive template sequences, such as a
              manually curated RepBase library, that may not exist for newly
              sequenced genomes. RESULTS: We have developed a software tool
              called WindowMasker (WM) that identifies and masks highly
              repetitive DNA sequences in a genome, using only the sequence of
              the genome itself. WM is orders of magnitude faster than RM
              because WM uses a few linear-time scans of the genome sequence,
              rather than local alignment methods that compare each library
              sequence with each piece of the genome. We validate WM by
              comparing BLAST outputs from large sets of queries applied to two
              versions of the same genome, one masked by WM, and the other
              masked by RM. Even for genomes such as the human genome, where a
              good RepBase library is available, searching the database as
              masked with WM yields more matches that are apparently
              non-repetitive and fewer matches to repetitive sequences. We show
              that these results hold for transcribed regions as well. WM also
              performs well on genomes for which much of the sequence was in
              draft form at the time of the analysis. AVAILABILITY: WM is
              included in the NCBI C++ toolkit. The source code for the entire

              ultra-long reads of ?100 kilo bases (kb) in average, full-length
              mRNA or cDNA reads in high throughput and genomic contigs over
              100 mega bases (Mb) in length. Existing alignment programs are
              unable or inefficient to process such data at scale, which
              presses for the development of new alignment algorithms. Results:
              Minimap2 is a general-purpose alignment program to map DNA or
              long mRNA sequences against a large reference database. It works
              with accurate short reads of $\geq$ 100bp in length, $\geq$1kb
              genomic reads at error rate ?15\%, full-length noisy Direct RNA
              or cDNA reads, and assembly contigs or closely related full
              chromosomes of hundreds of megabases in length. Minimap2 does
              split-read alignment, employs concave gap cost for long
              insertions and deletions (INDELs) and introduces new heuristics
              to reduce spurious alignments. It is 3-4 times as fast as
              mainstream short-read mappers at comparable accuracy, and is
              $\geq$30 times faster than long-read genomic or cDNA mappers at
              higher accuracy, surpassing most aligners specialized in one type
              of alignment. Availability and implementation:

  abstract = "Summary Arthropods comprise the largest and most diverse phylum
              on Earth and play vital roles in nearly every ecosystem. Their
              diversity stems in part from variations on a conserved body plan,
              resulting from and recorded in adaptive changes in the genome.
              Dissection of the genomic record of sequence change enables broad
              questions regarding genome evolution to be addressed, even across
              hyper-diverse taxa within arthropods. Using 76 whole genome
              sequences representing 21 orders spanning more than 500 million
              years of arthropod evolution, we document changes in gene and
              protein domain content and provide temporal and phylogenetic
              context for interpreting these innovations. We identify many
              novel gene families that arose early in the evolution of
              arthropods and during the diversification of insects into modern
              orders. We reveal unexpected variation in patterns of DNA
              methylation across arthropods and examples of gene family and
              protein domain evolution coincident with the appearance of
              notable phenotypic and physiological adaptations such as flight,
              metamorphosis, sociality and chemoperception. These analyses

              its sister taxon An. coluzzii through 5 generations of

  abstract  = "\#\#\# INTRODUCTION Control of mosquito vectors has historically
               proven to be an effective means of eliminating malaria. Human
               malaria is transmitted only by mosquitoes in the genus Anopheles
               , but not all species within the genus, or even all members of
               each vector species, are efficient malaria vectors. Variation in
               vectorial capacity for human malaria among Anopheles mosquito
               species is determined by many factors, including behavior,
               immunity, and life history. \#\#\# RATIONALE This variation in
               vectorial capacity suggests an underlying genetic/genomic
               plasticity that results in variation of key traits determining
               vectorial capacity within the genus. Sequencing the genome of
               Anopheles gambiae , the most important malaria vector in
               sub-Saharan Africa, has offered numerous insights into how that
               species became highly specialized to live among and feed upon
               humans and how susceptibility to mosquito control strategies is
               determined. Until very recently, similar genomic resources have
               not existed for other anophelines, limiting comparisons to
               individual genes or sets of genomic markers with no genome-wide
               data to investigate attributes associated with vectorial
               capacity across the genus. \#\#\# RESULTS We sequenced and
               assembled the genomes and transcriptomes of 16 anophelines from
               Africa, Asia, Europe, and Latin America, spanning ~100 million
               years of evolution and chosen to represent a range of
               evolutionary distances from An. gambiae , a variety of
               geographic locations and ecological conditions, and varying
               degrees of vectorial capacity. Genome assembly quality reflected
               DNA template quality and homozygosity. Despite variation in
               contiguity, the assemblies were remarkably complete and searches
               for arthropod-wide single-copy orthologs generally revealed few
               missing genes. Genome annotation supported with RNA sequencing
               transcriptomes yielded between 10,738 and 16,149 protein-coding
               genes for each species. Relative to Drosophila, the closest
               dipteran genus for which equivalent genomic resources exist,
               Anopheles exhibits a dynamic genomic evolutionary profile.
               Comparative analyses show a fivefold faster rate of gene gain
               and loss, elevated gene shuffling on the X chromosome, and more
               intron losses in Anopheles . Some determinants of vectorial
               capacity, such as chemosensory genes, do not show elevated
               turnover but instead diversify through protein-sequence changes.
               We also document evidence of variation in important reproductive
               phenotypes, genes controlling immunity to Plasmodium malaria
               parasites and other microbes, genes encoding cuticular and
               salivary proteins, and genes conferring metabolic insecticide
               resistance. This dynamism of anopheline genes and genomes may
               contribute to their flexible capacity to take advantage of new
               ecological niches, including adapting to humans as primary
               hosts. \#\#\# CONCLUSIONS Anopheline mosquitoes exhibit a
               molecular evolutionary profile very distinct from Drosophila ,
               and their genomes harbor strong evidence of functional variation
               in traits that determine vectorial capacity. These 16 new
               reference genome assemblies provide a foundation for hypothesis
               generation and testing to further our understanding of the
               diverse biological traits that determine vectorial capacity.

               all sequenced anophelines and two mosquito outgroups was
               constructed from the aligned protein sequences of 1085
               single-copy orthologs. Shapes between branch termini and species
               names indicate vector status and are colored according to
               geographic ranges depicted on the map. Variation in vectorial
               capacity for human malaria among Anopheles mosquito species is
               determined by many factors, including behavior, immunity, and
               life history. To investigate the genomic basis of vectorial
               capacity and explore new avenues for vector control, we
               sequenced the genomes of 16 anopheline mosquito species from
               diverse locations spanning ~100 million years of evolution.
               Comparative analyses show faster rates of gene gain and loss,
               elevated gene shuffling on the X chromosome, and more intron
               losses, relative to Drosophila . Some determinants of vectorial
               capacity, such as chemosensory genes, do not show elevated
               turnover but instead diversify through protein-sequence changes.
               This dynamism of anopheline genes and genomes may contribute to
               their flexible capacity to take advantage of new ecological
               niches, including adapting to humans as primary hosts. Virtually
               everyone has first-hand experience with mosquitoes. Few
               recognize the subtle biological distinctions among these
               bloodsucking flies that render some bites mere nuisances and
               others the initiation of a potentially life-threatening
               infection. By sequencing the genomes of several mosquitoes in
               depth, Neafsey et al. and Fontaine et al. reveal clues that
               explain the mystery of why only some species of one genus of
               mosquitoes are capable of transmitting human malaria (see the
               Perspective by Clark and Messer). Science , this issue

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Heterochromatin plays an important role in chromosome
              function and gene regulation. Despite the availability of
              polytene chromosomes and genome sequence, the heterochromatin of
              the major malaria vector Anopheles gambiae has not been mapped
              and characterized. RESULTS: To determine the extent of
              heterochromatin within the An. gambiae genome, genes were
              physically mapped to the euchromatin-heterochromatin transition
              zone of polytene chromosomes. The study found that a minimum of
              232 genes reside in 16.6 Mb of mapped heterochromatin. Gene
              ontology analysis revealed that heterochromatin is enriched in
              genes with DNA-binding and regulatory activities. Immunostaining
              of the An. gambiae chromosomes with antibodies against Drosophila
              melanogaster heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) and the nuclear
              envelope protein lamin Dm0 identified the major invariable sites
              of the proteins' localization in all regions of pericentric
              heterochromatin, diffuse intercalary heterochromatin, and
              euchromatic region 9C of the 2R arm, but not in the compact
              intercalary heterochromatin. To better understand the molecular
              differences among chromatin types, novel Bayesian statistical
              models were developed to analyze genome features. The study found
              that heterochromatin and euchromatin differ in gene density and
              the coverage of retroelements and segmental duplications. The
              pericentric heterochromatin had the highest coverage of
              retroelements and tandem repeats, while intercalary
              heterochromatin was enriched with segmental duplications. We also
              provide evidence that the diffuse intercalary heterochromatin has
              a higher coverage of DNA transposable elements, minisatellites,
              and satellites than does the compact intercalary heterochromatin.
              The investigation of 42-Mb assembly of unmapped genomic scaffolds
              showed that it has molecular characteristics similar to
              cytologically mapped heterochromatin. CONCLUSIONS: Our results
              demonstrate that Anopheles polytene chromosomes and whole-genome
              shotgun assembly render the mapping and characterization of a
              significant part of heterochromatic scaffolds a possibility.
              These results reveal the strong association between
              characteristics of the genome features and morphological types of
              chromatin. Initial analysis of the An. gambiae heterochromatin
              provides a framework for its functional characterization and

              scaffolding technologies is accelerating the production of
              reference-quality assemblies for large eukaryotic genomes.
              However, haplotype divergence in regions of high heterozygosity
              often results in assemblers creating two copies rather than one
              copy of a region, leading to breaks in contiguity and
              compromising downstream steps such as gene annotation. Several
              tools have been developed to resolve this problem. However, they
              either focus only on removing contained duplicate regions, also
              known as haplotigs, or fail to use all the relevant information
              and hence make errors. RESULTS: Here we present a novel tool,
              purge\_dups, that uses sequence similarity and read depth to
              automatically identify and remove both haplotigs and heterozygous
              overlaps. In comparison with current tools, we demonstrate that
              purge\_dups can reduce heterozygous duplication and increase
              assembly continuity while maintaining completeness of the primary
              assembly. Moreover, purge\_dups is fully automatic and can easily
              be integrated into assembly pipelines. AVAILABILITY AND

              However, assembly of highly heterozygous genomes is still
              problematic when regional heterogeneity is so high that haplotype
              homology is not recognised during assembly. This results in
              regional duplication rather than consolidation into allelic
              variants and can cause issues with downstream analysis, for
              example variant discovery, or haplotype reconstruction using the
              diploid assembly with unpaired allelic contigs. RESULTS: A new

              the association of phenotypic traits with their genetic basis in
              this important mosquito. FINDINGS: Here we present a new
              high-quality A. funestus reference genome (AfunF3) assembled
              using 240$\times$ coverage of long-read single-molecule
              sequencing for contigging, combined with 100$\times$ coverage of
              short-read Hi-C data for chromosome scaffolding. The assembled
              contigs total 446 Mbp of sequence and contain substantial
              duplication due to alternative alleles present in the sequenced
              pool of mosquitos from the FUMOZ colony. Using alignment and
              depth-of-coverage information, these contigs were deduplicated to
              a 211 Mbp primary assembly, which is closer to the expected
              haploid genome size of 250 Mbp. This primary assembly consists of
              1,053 contigs organized into 3 chromosome-scale scaffolds with an
              N50 contig size of 632 kbp and an N50 scaffold size of 93.811
              Mbp, representing a 100-fold improvement in continuity versus the

              R26T and Ag1, isolated from different strains of A. gambiae. The
              two bacterial strains are identical with a few exceptions.
              Phylogenetically, Elizabethkingia is closer to Chryseobacterium

  abstract = "Anopheles gambiae is the principal vector of malaria, a disease
              that afflicts more than 500 million people and causes more than 1
              million deaths each year. Tenfold shotgun sequence coverage was
              obtained from the PEST strain of A. gambiae and assembled into
              scaffolds that span 278 million base pairs. A total of 91\% of
              the genome was organized in 303 scaffolds; the largest scaffold
              was 23.1 million base pairs. There was substantial genetic
              variation within this strain, and the apparent existence of two
              haplotypes of approximately equal frequency (``dual haplotypes'')
              in a substantial fraction of the genome likely reflects the
              outbred nature of the PEST strain. The sequence produced a
              conservative inference of more than 400,000 single-nucleotide
              polymorphisms that showed a markedly bimodal density
              distribution. Analysis of the genome sequence revealed strong
              evidence for about 14,000 protein-encoding transcripts. Prominent
              expansions in specific families of proteins likely involved in
              cell adhesion and immunity were noted. An expressed sequence tag

              Arabidopsis thaliana, the widely cultivated Vitis vinifera cv.
              Cabernet Sauvignon, and the coral fungus Clavicorona pyxidata,

              are necessary for samples containing a mixture of genotypes,
              whether they are natural or experimentally combined. Multiplexing
              across donors is a popular experimental design that can avoid
              batch effects, reduce costs and improve doublet detection. By
              using variants detected in scRNA-seq reads, it is possible to
              assign cells to their donor of origin and identify cross-genotype
              doublets that may have highly similar transcriptional profiles,
              precluding detection by transcriptional profile. More subtle
              cross-genotype variant contamination can be used to estimate the
              amount of ambient RNA. Ambient RNA is caused by cell lysis before
              droplet partitioning and is an important confounder of scRNA-seq
              analysis. Here we develop souporcell, a method to cluster cells
              using the genetic variants detected within the scRNA-seq reads.
              We show that it achieves high accuracy on genotype clustering,
              doublet detection and ambient RNA estimation, as demonstrated

  abstract  = "\#\#\# INTRODUCTION Control of mosquito vectors has historically
               proven to be an effective means of eliminating malaria. Human
               malaria is transmitted only by mosquitoes in the genus Anopheles
               , but not all species within the genus, or even all members of
               each vector species, are efficient malaria vectors. Variation in
               vectorial capacity for human malaria among Anopheles mosquito
               species is determined by many factors, including behavior,
               immunity, and life history. \#\#\# RATIONALE This variation in
               vectorial capacity suggests an underlying genetic/genomic
               plasticity that results in variation of key traits determining
               vectorial capacity within the genus. Sequencing the genome of
               Anopheles gambiae , the most important malaria vector in
               sub-Saharan Africa, has offered numerous insights into how that
               species became highly specialized to live among and feed upon
               humans and how susceptibility to mosquito control strategies is
               determined. Until very recently, similar genomic resources have
               not existed for other anophelines, limiting comparisons to
               individual genes or sets of genomic markers with no genome-wide
               data to investigate attributes associated with vectorial
               capacity across the genus. \#\#\# RESULTS We sequenced and
               assembled the genomes and transcriptomes of 16 anophelines from
               Africa, Asia, Europe, and Latin America, spanning ~100 million
               years of evolution and chosen to represent a range of
               evolutionary distances from An. gambiae , a variety of
               geographic locations and ecological conditions, and varying
               degrees of vectorial capacity. Genome assembly quality reflected
               DNA template quality and homozygosity. Despite variation in
               contiguity, the assemblies were remarkably complete and searches
               for arthropod-wide single-copy orthologs generally revealed few
               missing genes. Genome annotation supported with RNA sequencing
               transcriptomes yielded between 10,738 and 16,149 protein-coding
               genes for each species. Relative to Drosophila, the closest
               dipteran genus for which equivalent genomic resources exist,
               Anopheles exhibits a dynamic genomic evolutionary profile.
               Comparative analyses show a fivefold faster rate of gene gain
               and loss, elevated gene shuffling on the X chromosome, and more
               intron losses in Anopheles . Some determinants of vectorial
               capacity, such as chemosensory genes, do not show elevated
               turnover but instead diversify through protein-sequence changes.
               We also document evidence of variation in important reproductive
               phenotypes, genes controlling immunity to Plasmodium malaria
               parasites and other microbes, genes encoding cuticular and
               salivary proteins, and genes conferring metabolic insecticide
               resistance. This dynamism of anopheline genes and genomes may
               contribute to their flexible capacity to take advantage of new
               ecological niches, including adapting to humans as primary
               hosts. \#\#\# CONCLUSIONS Anopheline mosquitoes exhibit a
               molecular evolutionary profile very distinct from Drosophila ,
               and their genomes harbor strong evidence of functional variation
               in traits that determine vectorial capacity. These 16 new
               reference genome assemblies provide a foundation for hypothesis
               generation and testing to further our understanding of the
               diverse biological traits that determine vectorial capacity.

               other dipterans. The maximum likelihood molecular phylogeny of
               all sequenced anophelines and two mosquito outgroups was
               constructed from the aligned protein sequences of 1085
               single-copy orthologs. Shapes between branch termini and species
               names indicate vector status and are colored according to
               geographic ranges depicted on the map. Variation in vectorial
               capacity for human malaria among Anopheles mosquito species is
               determined by many factors, including behavior, immunity, and
               life history. To investigate the genomic basis of vectorial
               capacity and explore new avenues for vector control, we
               sequenced the genomes of 16 anopheline mosquito species from
               diverse locations spanning ~100 million years of evolution.
               Comparative analyses show faster rates of gene gain and loss,
               elevated gene shuffling on the X chromosome, and more intron
               losses, relative to Drosophila . Some determinants of vectorial
               capacity, such as chemosensory genes, do not show elevated
               turnover but instead diversify through protein-sequence changes.
               This dynamism of anopheline genes and genomes may contribute to
               their flexible capacity to take advantage of new ecological
               niches, including adapting to humans as primary hosts. Virtually
               everyone has first-hand experience with mosquitoes. Few
               recognize the subtle biological distinctions among these
               bloodsucking flies that render some bites mere nuisances and
               others the initiation of a potentially life-threatening
               infection. By sequencing the genomes of several mosquitoes in
               depth, Neafsey et al. and Fontaine et al. reveal clues that
               explain the mystery of why only some species of one genus of
               mosquitoes are capable of transmitting human malaria (see the
               Perspective by Clark and Messer). Science , this issue

  abstract = "Summary Arthropods comprise the largest and most diverse phylum
              on Earth and play vital roles in nearly every ecosystem. Their
              diversity stems in part from variations on a conserved body plan,
              resulting from and recorded in adaptive changes in the genome.
              Dissection of the genomic record of sequence change enables broad
              questions regarding genome evolution to be addressed, even across
              hyper-diverse taxa within arthropods. Using 76 whole genome
              sequences representing 21 orders spanning more than 500 million
              years of arthropod evolution, we document changes in gene and
              protein domain content and provide temporal and phylogenetic
              context for interpreting these innovations. We identify many
              novel gene families that arose early in the evolution of
              arthropods and during the diversification of insects into modern
              orders. We reveal unexpected variation in patterns of DNA
              methylation across arthropods and examples of gene family and
              protein domain evolution coincident with the appearance of
              notable phenotypic and physiological adaptations such as flight,
              metamorphosis, sociality and chemoperception. These analyses

              broad new insights into the genotype to phenotype map and
              generate testable hypotheses about the evolution of animal
